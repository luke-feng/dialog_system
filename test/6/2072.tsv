2012-05-20T18:07:00.000Z	D[4]ni		i don't like close-minimize-maximize, i'd rather have close-maximize-minimize

2012-05-20T18:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	D[4]ni	 from whative googled. you cant reorder them in the top panel. but you can in the window title
2012-05-20T18:14:00.000Z	D[4]ni	Dr_Willis	i already changed it in the titlebar
2012-05-20T18:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	D[4]ni	 I did see some indicator-applet mentioned that  did the same feature. it may have been more changeable. check the webupd8 postings - it was either this week or last week i saw it mentioned
