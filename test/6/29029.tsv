2010-10-11T02:07:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kyentei	 well I had mostly already decided, I need to stop upgrading every six months, that's why LTS's exist ;)
2010-10-11T02:07:00.000Z	kyentei	zcat[1]	Ah, may I ask why you need to stop upgrading?
2010-10-11T02:09:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kyentei	 I waste too much time upgrading systems that already do everything I need just to get a few fancy pointless new features that I don't..
2010-10-11T02:09:00.000Z	kyentei	zcat[1]	Okay, then suit yourself ^_^
2010-10-11T02:09:00.000Z	zcat[1]	kyentei	 But I will probably grab an ISO have have a play anyhow...
