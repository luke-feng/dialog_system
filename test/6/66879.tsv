2009-08-28T14:41:00.000Z	XQbit		what is he supposed to write then?
2009-08-28T14:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XQbit	+1 what MenZa suggested
2009-08-28T14:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XQbit	or boot to recovery root console, you will need to umount the partitions
2009-08-28T14:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XQbit	its like chkdsk in windows
2009-08-28T14:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	XQbit	i suggest getting one thats generic to Linux rather than simply ubuntu specific, it will prepare you for any distro then
