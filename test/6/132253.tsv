2006-09-19T09:13:00.000Z	Samuli^	zenofjazz	I've had my problems with it. :)
2006-09-19T09:32:00.000Z	Samuli^	zenofjazz	I really don't know :)
2006-09-19T09:33:00.000Z	Samuli^	zenofjazz	maybe it's just a bug in the motherboard bios, if there's chance to update it, try that first.
2006-09-19T09:34:00.000Z	Samuli^	zenofjazz	you're using the motherboard raid controller right?
2006-09-19T09:38:00.000Z	Samuli^	zenofjazz	motherboard sata-controllers with raid are always software.
