2010-05-13T20:11:00.000Z	spiderbone		why I can't install ubuntu on my real computer but installs fine on vmware?
2010-05-13T20:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spiderbone	 and the problem with the real computer is what exactly? tell the channel what its doing and what its not doing.
2010-05-13T20:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	spiderbone	 verify the md5sums?  Try a iso to flash drive and install from flash type install?
