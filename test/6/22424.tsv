2010-04-08T21:04:00.000Z	solexious		When trying to setup mysql from the instructions from the ubuntu wiki at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP when trying to set the mysql root password with 'mysql -u root' I get the error 'ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)' Any ideas what i'm doing wrong?
