2009-11-22T02:55:00.000Z	JGodbout		I have a HDD with just 1 NTFS partition on it. There seems to be some problems on the hard drive, as Windows can't mount it, and when I try to copy certain files, it gives me a "Error stating file '/media/disk-1/Doc...5.tmp': Input/output error". Is there some kind of command that I can run on the partition to "fix" these problems so that Windows can use the HDD?

2009-11-22T03:00:00.000Z	JGodbout	guntbert	It appears that I can use this so called ntfsck program in the ntfsprogs package
