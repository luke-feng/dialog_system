2006-05-25T08:47:00.000Z	duneatreides		can anyone help me? I am having difficulty making my cd burner to work
2006-05-25T08:48:00.000Z	duneatreides		I am new to Linux, and unfortunately I am used to doing things the M$ way
2006-05-25T08:49:00.000Z	duneatreides		well, I just installed ubuntu, and I'm testing out my system
2006-05-25T08:49:00.000Z	duneatreides		i'm trying to burn firefox-1.5.0.3 just as a test run
2006-05-25T08:49:00.000Z	graft	duneatreides	if you are willing to install kde libs, k3b is probably the best burning app on linux
