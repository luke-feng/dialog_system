2008-03-25T10:39:00.000Z	Ademan_		anyone here use something other than gnome-terminal and konsole ? i'm not dissatisfied, just curious if there's anything else worthwhile out there, and no one say xterm :-p
2008-03-25T10:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Ademan_	yakuake
2008-03-25T10:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Ademan_	or "tilda" for gnome
2008-03-25T10:40:00.000Z	Ademan_	prince_jammys	ah yeah, forgot about those, they're pretty cool, ultimately i decided i didn't need them though
2008-03-25T10:40:00.000Z	Ademan_		i just discovered Eterm, but that didn't provide anything terribly exciting imho
2008-03-25T10:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Ademan_	i can't live without my yakuake
