2006-06-10T06:07:00.000Z	mt3		Hi guys
2006-06-10T06:07:00.000Z	mt3		I wasn't really sure where to ask this
2006-06-10T06:07:00.000Z	mt3		I have a problem with a computer running Ubuntu... But it's not a Ubuntu problem :P
2006-06-10T06:08:00.000Z	mt3		Basically I set a password on the motherboard of my machine but it obviously isn't right because when I enter it to start up it says I entered it wrong! I tried taking the battery out and putting it back in and it didn't clear it. What can I do? It's an old Packard Bell system with a Celeron 859
