2009-06-07T10:10:00.000Z	scunizi	Asagrim	have you looked at man ls?
2009-06-07T10:11:00.000Z	Asagrim	scunizi	what?
2009-06-07T10:12:00.000Z	scunizi	Asagrim	ls give directory listings.. there are switches to show file and directory sizes.  open a terminal and type " man ls " for docs
2009-06-07T10:12:00.000Z	Asagrim	scunizi	thanks, i will try
2009-06-07T10:19:00.000Z	scunizi	Asagrim	ls -lhR <path to beginning directory> --group-directories-first
