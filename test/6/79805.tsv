2007-09-01T16:35:00.000Z	lucashungaro	scipio	okay... I'm trying to be sure that I'm not going to lose my files... I have a 200GB hd, I want three partitions on it: 30 GB for Linux, ? GB for Swap and the remainder for my files
2007-09-01T16:36:00.000Z	scipio	lucashungaro	well if you already have files on it you know that there is no way to be 100% sure you won't lose something in the partitioning process. that being said i've done it many times without problems. swap size is dependant on your ram. how much for you?
2007-09-01T16:37:00.000Z	lucashungaro	scipio	1 gb
2007-09-01T16:37:00.000Z	scipio	lucashungaro	1 G of swap is enough then i think. ask again see if there are other opinions
2007-09-01T16:38:00.000Z	lucashungaro	scipio	ok, thank you very much
2007-09-01T16:38:00.000Z	scipio	lucashungaro	you're welcome
