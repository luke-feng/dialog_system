2009-10-15T07:30:00.000Z	lifesengine		anyone have a client idea for file transfers?
2009-10-15T07:31:00.000Z	losha	lifesengine	how big a file? One time or multiple times. What's on the remote end?
2009-10-15T07:32:00.000Z	lifesengine	losha	multiple times is ideal
2009-10-15T07:33:00.000Z	losha	lifesengine	split the file into 2 and use rapidshare...
2009-10-15T07:34:00.000Z	lifesengine	losha	solid ideal, but i'm looking to possibly constantly have a flow of data back and forth
2009-10-15T07:35:00.000Z	losha	lifesengine	usser's idea is good too, but needs a bit more setup...
