2007-01-08T12:34:00.000Z	aztracker1	riotkittie	part of it, is that I am working at home, and the work stuff is in windows, the other part, is after today, I've spent vastly more time getting things to work, than I spent the rest of my lifetime in windows.
2007-01-08T12:35:00.000Z	riotkittie	aztracker1	ah :(
2007-01-08T12:36:00.000Z	aztracker1	riotkittie	I don't knock it too much, I have a few clients I switched to it.. it just doesn't suit my needs..
2007-01-08T12:36:00.000Z	riotkittie	aztracker1	understandable.
