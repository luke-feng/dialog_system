2005-07-27T15:33:00.000Z	cafuego	qt2	Yes. Also #kubuntu, #ubuntu-doc
2005-07-27T15:34:00.000Z	qt2	cafuego	so there's no dev channel?
2005-07-27T15:34:00.000Z	cafuego	qt2	There probably is.
2005-09-17T06:05:00.000Z	cafuego	qt2	/usr/share/doc/eggdrop
2005-09-17T06:06:00.000Z	qt2	cafuego	u always thought that /usr/share/doc/ was only for documentation?
