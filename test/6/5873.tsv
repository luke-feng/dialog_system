2011-10-22T00:40:00.000Z	SuprEngr	boxbeatsy	it's because you can't... & can't install widgets wither :(  giv'em time they'll sort it out
2011-10-22T00:40:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	SuprEngr	what do you mean?
2011-10-22T00:42:00.000Z	SuprEngr	boxbeatsy	it's taken the same line as first founfdin 10.04 netbook.  the panel is not for us plebs!
2011-10-22T00:42:00.000Z	SuprEngr		*found in
2011-10-22T00:46:00.000Z	SuprEngr	boxbeatsy	there's way around some missing add-ons; e.g. xpad instead of note, docky can do some others... but I miss the panel apps being available... most annoying other panel miss is no weather option for date/time
