2007-05-10T08:33:00.000Z	stanthecaddy22	nonlinear	have it check for CD boot before booting to hard drive
2007-05-10T08:33:00.000Z	nonlinear	stanthecaddy22	yea, but i would like to add the CD option to grub, so that I don't have to hit F12 if i want to boot CD... i can just select it in grub
2007-05-10T08:34:00.000Z	nonlinear	stanthecaddy22	yea, i can do it in bios but i'm lazy and it would be nice to have in grub
