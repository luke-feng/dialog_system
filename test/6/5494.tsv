2011-11-02T09:07:00.000Z	johnnyzero		Perhaps I should go onto IRC in Lubuntu 11.10 so I could tell you exactly my findings
2011-11-02T09:08:00.000Z	johnnyzero		Hmm yet I can get Microphone support on 10.10 but not 11.10
2011-11-02T09:08:00.000Z	johnnyzero		Thats really strange
2011-11-02T09:08:00.000Z	johnnyzero		ok
