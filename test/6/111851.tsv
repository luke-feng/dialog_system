2006-07-06T07:08:00.000Z	farky	dli	yes
2006-07-06T07:08:00.000Z	farky	dli	have it installed not, but I think as Sleeping_Sloth said, it is in the multiverse
2006-07-06T07:20:00.000Z	dli	farky	debian can run on 128MB ram for sure
2006-07-06T07:21:00.000Z	farky	dli	i know, it justs runs pretty sluggishly, but it is manageable
2006-07-06T07:22:00.000Z	dli	farky	650MB is not slow, 128MB is the reason, so, run debian, instead of ubuntu
