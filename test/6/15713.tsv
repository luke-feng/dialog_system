2010-10-20T10:34:00.000Z	TheProf	nullm0dem	Hello. Did you get a chance to try FreeNX?
2010-10-20T10:35:00.000Z	nullm0dem	TheProf	im trying it now don't seem to see any change from my 10.04 setup
2010-10-20T10:35:00.000Z	TheProf	nullm0dem	Do you find that it is performing well?
2010-10-20T10:36:00.000Z	TheProf		I am comparing it to my other server which is an old Fedora 10 installation.  The FreeNX performance was amazing - almost like sitting at the console.
2010-10-20T10:37:00.000Z	nullm0dem	TheProf	it seems to be consistent with what i am used too. i am connecting to a server that is still running 10.04 though
2010-10-20T10:37:00.000Z	TheProf	nullm0dem	Hmm..OK. I am not sure why I'm having this performance issue.
