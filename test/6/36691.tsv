2009-05-24T12:37:00.000Z	njathan		i have an intel core2duo processor laptop. Should i use Ubuntu 32bit? or 64bit iso?
2009-05-24T12:38:00.000Z	dSlaM	njathan	how many ram ?
2009-05-24T12:38:00.000Z	njathan		2 gigs
2009-05-24T12:38:00.000Z	dSlaM		32 will works fine
2009-05-24T12:38:00.000Z	njathan	dSlaM	2 gigs of it
2009-05-24T12:40:00.000Z	dSlaM	njathan	u can run both of em, but in my experience the prime advantage of 64 bits is the "takingg account of more than 4g RAM" (sorry for the english here)
