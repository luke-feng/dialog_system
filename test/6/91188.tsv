2011-01-28T20:55:00.000Z	david234		I want to automatically encode wave files into MP3 files on my Ubuntu server. I read Ubuntu does not include mp3 because of licensing issues. How do I encode files into MP3 on my server and respect laws in Canada and the USA ?

2011-01-28T20:57:00.000Z	nexes	david234	But you'll notice that Winamp and other free media players don't pay for mp3 licensing, only commercial, paid products and hardware.
