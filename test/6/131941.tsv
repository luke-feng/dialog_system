2009-12-24T05:31:00.000Z	forceflow		there's an option in UNR titled "use regular desktop"
2009-12-24T05:32:00.000Z	forceflow		first I enabled that, that got rid of the launcher, and gave me regular gnome desktop
2009-12-24T05:32:00.000Z	forceflow		then in startup apps, I removed maximus
2009-12-24T05:32:00.000Z	forceflow		and that's it :)
2009-12-24T05:32:00.000Z	LjL	forceflow	hmm, i think i heard it had been removed for some reason or another in 9.10...? not entirely sure though
