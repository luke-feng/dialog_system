2008-04-18T06:19:00.000Z	ccole0		having an serious video performance issue with my laptop.  It has a Radeon x300 card in it, but everything is slow, either effects on or off.  What driver should I be using?
2008-04-18T06:21:00.000Z	ccole0		oh, sorry, I should have said, I am using 8.04 RC updated to current, but it was pretty bad even on the 7.10 version
