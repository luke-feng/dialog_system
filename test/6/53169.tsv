2012-06-18T21:22:00.000Z	vampirnata		anyone know how to check gpu temp in cli? I'm using sensors but it only gives 1 temp and i think it's the mainboard temp
2012-06-18T21:22:00.000Z	vampirnata		i have that installed
2012-06-18T21:23:00.000Z	vampirnata		running it gives me only my core/motherboard temps
2012-06-18T21:23:00.000Z	vampirnata		it's an atom processor
