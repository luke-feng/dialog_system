2010-03-21T07:46:00.000Z	void_pointer	EastDallas	that's what I do with mine, anyway
2010-03-21T07:47:00.000Z	EastDallas	void_pointer	Using the older version of grub doesn't cause any problems with any of the other updates?
2010-03-21T07:47:00.000Z	void_pointer	EastDallas	not that I've found
2010-03-21T07:48:00.000Z	void_pointer	EastDallas	if you can be bothered, you can adjust whatever changes the grub update makes. I can never be bothered
2010-03-21T07:48:00.000Z	EastDallas	void_pointer	I thought that might be the answer, but It's good to hear it from someone else.
