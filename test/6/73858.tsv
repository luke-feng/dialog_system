2007-11-20T12:44:00.000Z	TimBaxter		I've recently installed the 32-bit version of Ubuntu on my laptop. I have an AMD64 CPU, is there any real advantage to me installing the 64 bit version of Ubuntu?

2007-11-20T12:47:00.000Z	TimBaxter	desertc	If I'm only really only doing home-use stuff, am I likely to run into any big 32-bit vs. 64-bit compatibility issues?

2007-11-20T12:51:00.000Z	desertc	TimBaxter	I have been using it for 4 years, no issues.
