2008-10-26T11:58:00.000Z	ltracy__		Is the Ubuntu Server Ubuntu channel some sort of alias of this or something (i.e. if I go join that will I see myself?)
2008-10-26T11:58:00.000Z	ltracy__		<--- had a bit of wine.  May not make sense :)
2008-10-26T12:00:00.000Z	dulak	ltracy__	#ubuntu-server is a different channel
2008-10-26T12:00:00.000Z	ltracy__		This one is probably much better
2008-10-26T12:01:00.000Z	dulak	ltracy__	if you are using 8.04 people in here should be able to help
2008-10-26T12:02:00.000Z	ltracy__	dulak	:) No problems right now.  Every time I went to the other one, though, the only answered questions were "Which button do I push in update manager GUI to make updates happen" type questions.  It was rather frustrating when I had actual problems.
