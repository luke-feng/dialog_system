2007-12-24T21:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	KindOne	 try alt-f2 and run 'xterm'   Im wondering if your system dont have some serious issues.
2007-12-24T21:38:00.000Z	KindOne	Dr_willis	what do you think is wrong with my terminal ?
2007-12-24T21:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	KindOne	 if you can get an xterm going you could try typing in 'gnome-terminal' and see if it still crashes
