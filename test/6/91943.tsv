2007-08-04T09:48:00.000Z	ShackJack	bullgard4	Should just be with other folders...
2007-08-04T09:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	ShackJack	I understand you barely. Say it in other words, please.
2007-08-04T09:50:00.000Z	ShackJack	bullgard4	Ummm. the list of folders in the left pane of Evolution, Inbox, Sent, etc... there should be one for trash or deleted items...
2007-08-04T09:51:00.000Z	bullgard4	ShackJack	Yes, indeed: On the left-hand plane. I have overlooked it. Thank you for hinting.
2007-08-04T09:51:00.000Z	ShackJack	bullgard4	You're welcome...
