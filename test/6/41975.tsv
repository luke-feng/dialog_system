2009-06-15T23:07:00.000Z	Bram_P		hello, is it legal to download videos from youtube for myself? And what program would you recomend me with ubuntu?
2009-06-15T23:08:00.000Z	Radtoo	Bram_P	Most likely it is, depending on where you live. And I'd recommend a firefox plugin for that, if you use firefox.
2009-06-15T23:09:00.000Z	Bram_P	Radtoo	well, I live in The Netherlands, so probably it is, what firefox plugin can do that?
2009-06-15T23:09:00.000Z	Radtoo	Bram_P	check out the official firefox addon page over at addons.mozilla.org. Pick one of the video downloading plugins, and read its instructions. Its real easy. After you downloaded the youtube vid, like any media player can be used to play it.
2009-06-15T23:09:00.000Z	Bram_P	Radtoo	ok, thanks!
2009-06-15T23:12:00.000Z	Radtoo	Bram_P	No problem. As for which is best out of the dozen or so they have, I don't actually know. Just pick some and try if they work well enough. >D
