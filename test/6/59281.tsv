2008-04-28T01:55:00.000Z	jayb2009		Just wondering if its a vmware like option or what?

2008-04-28T01:57:00.000Z	jayb2009	nibsa1242b	thanks...do you know if i setup this for a customer what the performance issues are? And can wubi run within windows running?
2008-04-28T02:00:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	jayb2009	I haven't used it yet. However, my understanding is that it is essentially like a normal linux dual-boot install with the exception that it resides in a folder on the FAT/NTFS (windows) drive. So other then possible performance implications of writing to FAT / NTFS I think is should be about normal speed.
2008-04-28T02:02:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	jayb2009	I think its best feature is to be able to test out Ubuntu without having to worry about harming the existing Windows install (no mbr changes, no worring about GRUB, etc).
