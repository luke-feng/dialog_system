2008-11-27T02:31:00.000Z	RomD		hi, I've got a problem regarding the nvidia drivers and Ubuntu 8.10 x64. I actived v177.80 drivers and restarted. Now I can't get into the GUI anymore. "startx" returns "no screens found". I already re-installed and activated again, but same result. I'm using two nvidia cards and three monitors.
