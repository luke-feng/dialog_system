2009-07-23T11:08:00.000Z	velcroshooz		somehow my 32 bit compatibility libs are not installed in the correct place, trying to run 32 video game apps gets me unable to find libGL.so.1 errors, i know they are on the system somewhere I just dont know why the programs arent finding them, anyone have any ideas?
2009-07-23T11:10:00.000Z	mazda01__	velcroshooz	create symlinks to them then. just do a find / -name libGL.so.1 and put a symlink where the program wants it to be.
2009-07-23T11:10:00.000Z	mazda01__	velcroshooz	 i don't use 64bit so that's the best I cna help with that.
2009-07-23T11:11:00.000Z	velcroshooz	mazda01__	problem is i dont know where its looking for it ;/
2009-07-23T11:13:00.000Z	mazda01__	velcroshooz	 yeah, sorry. i don';t; use 64bit so I couldn't tell you where it shoudl be. mine is located here: /usr/lib/ and it's a symlink. see here: lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root       15 2009-07-08 01:46 libGL.so.1 -> libGL.so.180.44
2009-07-23T11:14:00.000Z	mazda01__	velcroshooz	 i also have directories /usr/lib32/ and /usr/lib64/ but it's not in those directories
