2008-06-01T05:16:00.000Z	mythomaniac	Jack_Sparrow	correct, however, i seem to have a problem with getting sudoer's file syntax down to allow it to startup after a boot, for example <username> ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/firestarter does not work, also adding <username> ALL=(ALL) ALL does not resolve the issue...
