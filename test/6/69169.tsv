2009-06-23T03:51:00.000Z	tsrk	flamsmark	yeah, you have to update through each version
2009-06-23T03:52:00.000Z	tsrk	flamsmark	if you're going through more than one version it might be better to just do a fresh install because things can get messed up in upgrades and most stuff is easy to backup and will be exactly the same when you restore it
2009-06-23T03:54:00.000Z	flamsmark	tsrk	- as in, the system won't work? i have practically nothing on this machine
