2005-12-31T08:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	a_new_user	you need to add multiunivers and universe repos to your sources.list
2005-12-31T08:22:00.000Z	a_new_user	gnomefreak	ie: checking the multiunivers boxes as well as the univers?
2005-12-31T08:23:00.000Z	gnomefreak	a_new_user	 you cant add multi that way
2005-12-31T08:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	a_new_user	 a good idea would be to replace your /etc/apt/sources.list with the ones on that page
