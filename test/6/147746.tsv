2005-11-17T15:02:00.000Z	libben		any gui app for this ?
2005-11-17T15:02:00.000Z	libben		for extracting iso
2005-11-17T15:04:00.000Z	libben		like in extract the content of it. but in linux u can mount them, like daemon tools for windows. and then just copy the files from there.
2005-11-17T15:04:00.000Z	nalioth	libben	the copy protections built into the xbox iso may make it hard to mount
2005-11-17T15:05:00.000Z	libben	nalioth	its not an original. its a backed up iso. so its ok that way
