2010-02-07T01:39:00.000Z	kprav33n	actionParsnip	I just heard about it today. Still, trying to understand the difference between Chrome and Chromium. Googling and Wikipediaing about it.

2010-02-07T01:39:00.000Z	kprav33n	actionParsnip	Oh, Okay!
2010-02-07T01:40:00.000Z	kprav33n	actionParsnip	That is great! Extensions is what I want! So, Chromium is the right pick for me.
