2008-03-29T22:36:00.000Z	Bellar		I just downloaded and burnt a CD with Ubuntu 7.10, and I am trying to install it on a system. The CD has been running for more than two hours, and only the desktop and a window titled "Install" are shown.
2008-03-29T22:37:00.000Z	Bellar		I need to get this installed.
2008-03-29T22:37:00.000Z	gpm	Bellar	click on the install icon to start the installer?
2008-03-29T22:39:00.000Z	gpm	Bellar	is this a super old system?
2008-03-29T22:40:00.000Z	gpm	Bellar	maybe try the alternate install CD
