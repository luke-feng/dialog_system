2011-07-27T18:26:00.000Z	koichirose		I set environmnent variables in my .bashrc file. Is it correct? It's not really working: I can echo the variables from bash, but can't use them in a script.
2011-07-27T18:26:00.000Z	sipior	koichirose	how are you setting the variables?
2011-07-27T18:28:00.000Z	koichirose	sipior	VARIABLE=/path/to/dir
2011-07-27T18:28:00.000Z	sipior	koichirose	try "export VARIABLE=foo"
2011-07-27T18:30:00.000Z	koichirose	sipior	it works, thanks
2011-07-27T18:30:00.000Z	sipior	koichirose	no trouble
