2011-05-01T11:52:00.000Z	PythonPup	Maahes	Doen's Mplayer have hardware accel?
2011-05-01T11:53:00.000Z	PythonPup	Maahes	Doesn't Mplayer have hardware accel?
2011-05-01T11:53:00.000Z	Maahes	PythonPup	I wouldn't be the one to know, since I asked if vlc was the only one.
2011-05-01T11:53:00.000Z	PythonPup	Maahes	so, take my question as a hint and check.
