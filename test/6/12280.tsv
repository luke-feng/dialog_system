It was very snappy (much moreso than XP) but the only problem was when you got a lot going at once it slowed down a bit. I had a 2GB swap though so it wasn't oo bad but still. Normal Ubuntu 10.10 so I'd say that'd be fine with GNOME.

2011-02-08T04:35:00.000Z	Starminn	jotgroup	Just throw GNOME on it, then  if that's too slow for you try Xubuntu/ I've tried a LiveCD of Xubuntu (around same time as LiveCD for GNOME so it was CD vs. CD and not HDD vs. CD) and I noticed such a small difference that it wasn't worth giving up my pretty desktop.
2011-02-08T04:35:00.000Z	jotgroup		Thanx Starminn :)
2011-02-08T04:35:00.000Z	Starminn	jotgroup	I just don't know anything about processors. But 40GB space and 512MB RAM is exactly what I had/have (recently got more RAM but I see very little difference).
2011-02-08T04:36:00.000Z	Starminn	jotgroup	Yep, not a problem.
