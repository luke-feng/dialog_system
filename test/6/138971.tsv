2006-03-30T12:08:00.000Z	Nabiki		I see. :)
2006-03-30T12:10:00.000Z	Nabiki		  /j #cedega
2006-03-30T12:10:00.000Z	Nabiki		Has anyone here used cedega?
2006-03-30T12:12:00.000Z	frank23	Nabiki	I used cedega for WoW. It worked fine (after I configured it properly)
2006-03-30T12:13:00.000Z	Nabiki	frank23	For me it freezes up a lot..  I haven't even installed a game yet. O.o;;
