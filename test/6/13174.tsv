2011-05-11T03:17:00.000Z	Captainkrtek	ChesterX	I wouldn't reccomend it
2011-05-11T03:17:00.000Z	Captainkrtek	ChesterX	there is the netbook remix though :)
2011-05-11T03:18:00.000Z	ChesterX	Captainkrtek	does it also exist in a 64-bit variant?
2011-05-11T03:18:00.000Z	Captainkrtek		yes hold on dagnachewa
2011-05-11T03:18:00.000Z	Captainkrtek	ChesterX	I think so, check my mirror, mirror.slashdev.org/ubuntu
