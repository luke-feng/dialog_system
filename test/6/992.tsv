2012-08-28T00:31:00.000Z	thufir_	Zeptis	I'm following directions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mailman    and they don't work, though. at least not for me.
2012-08-28T00:33:00.000Z	Zeptis	thufir_	I really hope you get the help you need, but there is an #apache room, and they would know more about that specifically. Just saying.
