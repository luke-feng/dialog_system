2006-11-23T08:46:00.000Z	teledyn	ataq	ru serious it wouldn't run on an intel mac?  isn't it just the same as any other intel notebook?
2006-11-23T08:46:00.000Z	ataq	teledyn	its Intel CPU, PPC arch (I think)
2006-11-23T08:47:00.000Z	teledyn	ataq	i think intel and ppc are separate arches
2006-11-23T08:48:00.000Z	teledyn	ataq	you would not install a ppc version on an intel system ever
2006-11-23T08:51:00.000Z	teledyn	ataq	yeah you can't install their stuff on other boxes, but can install other stuff on their boxes.  they're control freaks.
