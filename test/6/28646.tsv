2009-11-06T03:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tenoch1	Sort of, via "moonlight"
2009-11-06T03:17:00.000Z	tenoch1	Jordan_U	yeah i was trying to watch nbcsports football game and it prompted me to install moonlight but it did not solve my problem
2009-11-06T03:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tenoch1	You may be out of luck
2009-11-06T03:22:00.000Z	tenoch1	Jordan_U	you think using wine to run windows firefox could work?
2009-11-06T03:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	tenoch1	Probably not, I did a quick search and didn't see anyone saying it worked ( and it would be a well known work around if it did )
