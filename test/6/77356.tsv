2008-08-07T22:17:00.000Z	bazhang	tsuna27	best to chat elsewhere; #ubuntu-offtopic is a nice place
2009-01-29T08:39:00.000Z	bazhang	tsuna27	what about the alternate cd
2009-01-29T08:39:00.000Z	bazhang	tsuna27	you should also md5 the iso, burn slowly and do the disk integrity check
2009-01-29T08:41:00.000Z	bazhang	tsuna27	sounds like a bad burn or a corrupt iso
