2008-06-03T01:32:00.000Z	mmiski	Kl4m	the samsung monitor is working (but is a clone of my laptop monitor)
2008-06-03T01:35:00.000Z	Kl4m	mmiski	are you sure that the laptop video card can manage 2 screens and not just clone?
2008-06-03T01:36:00.000Z	mmiski	Kl4m	I'm not sure what that means
2008-06-03T01:37:00.000Z	Kl4m	mmiski	Are you sure that the video output is for dual screens and not just a clone of the main output
2008-06-03T01:39:00.000Z	mmiski	Kl4m	it monitor resolution settings only shows one monitor (not two) and says "unknown" on it.  Before I installed the hardware driver for ATI it would show 2 monitors
