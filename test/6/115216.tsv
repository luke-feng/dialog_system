2006-06-11T09:11:00.000Z	gavagai	burepe2	mine can do:  /lastlog keyword
2006-06-11T09:11:00.000Z	gavagai	burepe2	it's all on your end, you can't query the server for that
2006-06-11T09:13:00.000Z	gavagai	burepe2	you can set up your irc client to log everything if you want, and delete the logs after X number of days
