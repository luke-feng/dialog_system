2008-01-03T05:24:00.000Z	tuntun		I installed gutsy from cd yesterday and to my pleasant surprise there wasn't a whole slew of updates waiting for download. So are they doing regular updates to the iso now? I really hope so!
2008-01-03T05:26:00.000Z	tuntun		<LjL-Mobile> Why did you have to ruin it!!!
2008-01-03T05:28:00.000Z	tuntun		<LjL-Mobile> :( at the end of the install process it DID say that complain about not having a connection and that they were commented out :(
2008-01-03T05:30:00.000Z	tuntun		I looked at the iso date on the http site and it said it was updated jan2, so are they doing regular updates to the iso with the latest package versions?
2008-01-03T05:31:00.000Z	kitche	tuntun	packages are the same unless they are security updates they might have just found a bug with the .sio
2008-01-03T05:32:00.000Z	kitche	tuntun	packages only get updated if it's a security update or a bug fix
