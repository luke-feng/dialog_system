2009-10-18T11:35:00.000Z	lilzeus	Dr_Willis	how do I go about doing that?
2009-10-18T11:37:00.000Z	lilzeus	Dr_Willis	it would seem my networking is caught up in some kind of loop back, every ping to 192.168.1.xxx address returns in 0.05ms, and every address 192.168.1.xxx in browser loops back to localhost of Apache's default "It works!" page
2009-10-18T11:37:00.000Z	lilzeus	Dr_Willis	I am unable to ping any other addresses
