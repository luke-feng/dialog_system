2008-11-29T05:42:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Tablettask	no you dont. there is also an "install" option on the live cd. or you can use the alternate cd for a text mode installer
2008-11-29T05:44:00.000Z	Tablettask	zsquareplusc	 and sFEARs : thanks ^^ i'll look into that when i have 8.10... but it doesnt matter what distro it is... tried the openSUSE live-cd as well xD something's strange with my ram i guess
2008-11-29T05:45:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	Tablettask	there is a ram checker on the cd :-)
2008-11-29T05:49:00.000Z	Tablettask	zsquareplusc	i know that too :P just took to long last time... gonna test it tomorrow when i'm away :P
