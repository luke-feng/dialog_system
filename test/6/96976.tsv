2008-02-14T01:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	twiztr	Sorry to come into this late, what was the problem
2008-02-14T01:28:00.000Z	twiztr	Jack_Sparrow	I have to reconfig my xserver, since my new screen won't display, since it wont do higher res then 1024, and I dont know what xserver to use for a ati x1550 card
2008-02-14T01:29:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	twiztr	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg   select vesa NO ATI   1024 x 768  to get back basic gui
