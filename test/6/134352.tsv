2006-03-25T16:28:00.000Z	Lamego	Mep30044	do not execute a command with sudo specially when you don't understand it
2006-03-25T16:29:00.000Z	Lamego	Mep30044	you dont install it, you extract it
2006-03-25T16:30:00.000Z	Lamego	Mep30044	it does run, if you know what is to be ran
2006-03-25T16:32:00.000Z	Lamego	Mep30044	you cd into the source, and run the binary which starts firefox
