2006-07-27T16:42:00.000Z	longwave	pkh	in that case i would just add this group you want all the users to be in as a secondary group using usermod -G
2006-07-27T16:42:00.000Z	pkh	longwave	what i saw on google seemed to indicate that was a way to go
2006-07-27T16:43:00.000Z	longwave	pkh	you can make the parent folder setgid to and all newly created files will be in the group of the parent folder, if that's what you want
2006-07-27T16:44:00.000Z	pkh	longwave	I think that sounds a bit too much here -- my main concern is that I'm going to be handing the day-to-day maintenance on to someone with even less admin knowledge (a difficult thing given my level)...
2006-07-27T16:45:00.000Z	longwave	pkh	just "sudo chmod g+s parentfolder", all newly created folders will have the same group as the parent then
