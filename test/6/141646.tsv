2006-10-01T15:11:00.000Z	lilliput		got this stuff when installed ubuntu so just wondering what was going on "FATAL ERROR: Bad logical partition 7: enlarged logical partitions overlap"
2006-10-01T15:11:00.000Z	Arafangion	lilliput	You have a corrupt partition table.
2006-10-01T15:11:00.000Z	Arafangion	lilliput	Use pastebin
2006-10-01T15:12:00.000Z	lilliput	Arafangion	I did guess that, but I used the ubuntu installer .. and did first free the partition using cfdisk  never had that pb ...
2006-10-01T15:15:00.000Z	lilliput	Arafangion	could you have a look and tell me what you think
