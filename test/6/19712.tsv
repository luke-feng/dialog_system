2012-07-11T16:56:00.000Z	ramez		I have dell vostro A860 and i can't install ubuntu 12.04
2012-07-11T16:56:00.000Z	Kruptein	ramez	with "I can't" do you mean the installation failed or something else?
2012-07-11T16:59:00.000Z	Kruptein	ramez	sorry, are your boot options correct?
2012-07-11T17:08:00.000Z	Kruptein	ramez	did you try to see if it boots on another pc/laptop ?
