2006-03-27T10:34:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	protocol1	 limewire is one of those pieces of software that any inteligent computer user wouldn't touch
2006-03-27T10:35:00.000Z	protocol1	FliesLikeABrick	what would you reccomend for dl'ing music?
2006-03-27T10:36:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	protocol1	I spend hours every week removing spyware and viruses from the computers of windows users that use limewire
2006-03-27T10:37:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	protocol1	of course downloading music is not quite legal, but it is said that bit-torrent is popular enough that it works
2006-03-27T10:37:00.000Z	FliesLikeABrick	protocol1	 almost any popular windows p2p client is a bad idea
