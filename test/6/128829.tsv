2007-07-12T05:25:00.000Z	astro76	Paul^	you can add them to /etc/hosts
2007-07-12T05:29:00.000Z	astro76	Paul^	sure if you're running a dns server you can add them
2007-07-12T05:29:00.000Z	Paul^	astro76	I'm stil um.. finding out how stuff works, but you'd say that would be managable on bind9?
2007-07-12T05:30:00.000Z	astro76	Paul^	I believe so
2007-07-12T05:30:00.000Z	Paul^	astro76	k, awesome, then I'm gonna find out :))
