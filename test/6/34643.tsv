2009-08-31T18:56:00.000Z	thinkertinker	erUSUL	but he has configured them by editing some .conf file doesn't remember which..his firefox is connected but not other applications
2009-08-31T18:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	thinkertinker	ahhh ok then it should be /etc/apt/apt.conf or something in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/*
2009-08-31T19:01:00.000Z	thinkertinker	erUSUL	we had to authenticate via a wi fi network so he added his username and password too in that file.. any new guesses??
2009-08-31T19:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	thinkertinker	... wpa_supplicant.conf ? /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf ? dunno...
