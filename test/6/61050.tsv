2009-04-20T18:47:00.000Z	dassouki		my computer's manual mentions that my laptop has a maximum memory of 2gb, why is that ?
2009-04-20T18:47:00.000Z	tyler_d	dassouki	b/c they had to limit it somewhere
2009-04-20T18:48:00.000Z	dassouki	tyler_d	so if i put a 2gb stick on top of the 1gb built in
2009-04-20T18:48:00.000Z	dassouki		will that work
2009-04-20T18:48:00.000Z	tyler_d	dassouki	no it will not... your computer may not even recognize the 2GB stick... max 2 GB means your best off going with 2 1GB sticks
2009-04-20T18:51:00.000Z	dassouki	tyler_d	umm any way i can overcome that ?
