2006-06-19T16:52:00.000Z	meandi		Hi, completely new to ubintu and I s?hall download an iso for installation on my PC. Shall I use ubuntu-6.06-alternate-i386.iso  or ubuntu-6.06-desktop-i386.iso?
2006-06-19T16:53:00.000Z	meandi		ok, what's the difference?
2006-06-19T16:55:00.000Z	meandi		ok, in that case I go for the alternate then. I am planning to set dual boot for XP and ubuntu
2006-06-19T16:56:00.000Z	meandi		thanks for the help!
2006-06-19T06:00:00.000Z	meandi		This is probably the right place to ask but I wounder about the developers of ubuntu, do they work for free or do they get paid for their work?
