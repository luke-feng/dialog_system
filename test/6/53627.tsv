2009-05-22T09:24:00.000Z	KurtKraut		What were the boot scripts afected by the change from bash to dash that happened in Ubuntu some time ago? Only those located in /etc/init.d ?
2009-05-22T09:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	KurtKraut	all scripts using /bin/sh use dash
2009-05-22T09:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	KurtKraut	/bin/sh in ubuntu is a symlink to /bin/dash
2009-05-22T09:27:00.000Z	KurtKraut	lstarnes	ok, but are other scripts not placed in /etc/init.d that would enhance the boot performance provided by the change from bash to dash?
2009-10-30T07:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	KurtKraut	where do you see that?
2009-10-30T07:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	KurtKraut	sorry, wrong user
