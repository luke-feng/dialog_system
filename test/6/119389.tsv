2006-06-09T10:12:00.000Z	LjL	raptros-v76	well, it's most definitely not
2006-06-09T10:13:00.000Z	LjL	raptros-v76	but then i agree it's not necessarily very useful either
2006-06-09T10:14:00.000Z	raptros-v76	LjL	no, its literaly impossible to install literally every package. its called conflicts.
2006-06-09T10:15:00.000Z	LjL	raptros-v76	true. although i'm not sure the CD would contain conflicting packages
2006-06-09T10:15:00.000Z	raptros-v76	LjL	but the packages on  the cd will be outdated
2006-06-09T10:16:00.000Z	LjL	raptros-v76	guess so, but then i think he was only asking about the cd packages
