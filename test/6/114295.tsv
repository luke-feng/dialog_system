2008-08-12T17:15:00.000Z	jrib	newbe1	nope
2008-10-12T18:02:00.000Z	jrib	newbe1	I don't understand your question.  Can you rephrase it?
2008-10-12T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	newbe1	sudo apt-get install wine
2008-10-28T16:02:00.000Z	jrib	newbe1	you aren't in #winehq...
2008-10-28T16:03:00.000Z	jrib	newbe1	so how does saying "looks like i am the only user in winehq" make any sense?
