2006-04-12T05:28:00.000Z	alnr		i get no-package for eclipse-jdt. i guess because i'm running hoary. can I get around it w/o fully upgrading to breezy?
2006-04-12T05:30:00.000Z	alnr		dare i type in apt-get dist-upgrade on a hoary system ? (to get to breezy)

2006-04-12T05:33:00.000Z	ompaul	alnr	okay before you do consider backing up your software, and having a breezy live or install cd to hand
