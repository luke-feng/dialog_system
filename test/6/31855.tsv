2009-10-06T09:06:00.000Z	webbb82	calebH	ya i just wanted something differant than the gnome menu
2009-10-06T09:07:00.000Z	calebH	webbb82	which "gnome menu" are you referring to?  The "menu bar" you get with a default installation of ubuntu?
2009-10-06T09:09:00.000Z	calebH	webbb82	well then, the "gnome-main-menu" package is not one of the ones that are pre-installed.  Have you tried it?
