2006-10-31T13:06:00.000Z	khermans_	timalot	look at /etc/acpi/lid.sh
2006-10-31T13:06:00.000Z	timalot	khermans_	exactly but how do i get that to run? after a specified time
2006-10-31T13:07:00.000Z	khermans_	timalot	a hack would be to symlink xscreensaver to it ;-)
2006-10-31T13:07:00.000Z	timalot	khermans_	might have to that :) .... ill keep looking for a bit
