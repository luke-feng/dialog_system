2011-06-05T10:43:00.000Z	tsok	boss8055	when watching a youtube video, replace the "youtube.com" with "keep-tube.com"
2011-06-05T10:43:00.000Z	tsok	boss8055	keep-tube is an online service that allows high-quality downloading of youtube videos, no watermark etc.
2011-06-05T10:45:00.000Z	tsok	boss8055	I'm not sure, I just now got ubuntu so I don't know about any /tmp folder.
