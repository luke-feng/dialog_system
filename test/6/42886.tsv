2009-02-10T02:21:00.000Z	G-Blunted	quentusrex	 probably means your permissions aren't right
2009-02-10T02:21:00.000Z	quentusrex	G-Blunted	I want to remove gconf keys....
2009-02-10T02:21:00.000Z	quentusrex	G-Blunted	But I can't find a way to dump the keys....
2009-02-10T02:23:00.000Z	G-Blunted	quentusrex	 gconf-edit....you gotta remove them one at a time
