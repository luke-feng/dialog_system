2012-05-18T22:26:00.000Z	ballroomblitz42		Now that support for Maverick has ended, I've got no choice but to upgrade.  Is there any way to do so without making major changes to the UI?
2012-05-18T22:27:00.000Z	L3top	ballroomblitz42	not really.
2012-05-18T22:27:00.000Z	L3top		I mean only that the UI is going to change, though it does not have to change as dramatically as unity.
2012-05-18T22:28:00.000Z	ballroomblitz42		Can I keep GNOME?
2012-05-18T22:28:00.000Z	L3top		gnome3 ballroomblitz42
2012-05-18T22:30:00.000Z	ballroomblitz42	L3top	so gnome2 is gone?
