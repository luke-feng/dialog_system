2007-05-29T06:14:00.000Z	philipsmith		Help! I've got an ubuntu machine with 2 hard drives: one is slave. I did an update, and the system said something about a bad superblock... and the machine would not reboot. So I resintalled Feisty. I'm trying to mount that second hard drive, but am having trouble seeing it anyplace can somebody tell where I should look? Is it in /dev/hda1 or something like that?
