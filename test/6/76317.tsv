2007-10-11T16:54:00.000Z	Tigey		I am new to linux, but not so new to Sun/Unix.  Trying to install flash on Ubuntu 64-bit.  Flash seems to be only in the x86 variety..  Anyone know what I can do alternatively?

2007-10-11T05:04:00.000Z	Tigey	pike_	This sets up a virtual 32-bit environment to install in right?
2007-10-11T05:05:00.000Z	pike_	Tigey	yeah
2007-10-11T05:06:00.000Z	Tigey	pike_	There does not seem to be a way to set up a feisty 32-bit type.  Still looking though...  <sigh>
