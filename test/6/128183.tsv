2007-09-29T15:35:00.000Z	Eleaf	bascule	yeah, there are a few nice rooms, but I was just looking for something that is general, not ##off-topic, and has some people.
2007-09-29T15:36:00.000Z	Eleaf	bascule	#landfill and #photogeeks is kinda nice, but there are often times not enough people.
2007-09-29T15:36:00.000Z	Eleaf		well, now I'm just getting my fresh reinstall up to snuff.
2007-09-29T15:36:00.000Z	Eleaf		nice having a 320GB harddrive now..
2007-09-29T15:37:00.000Z	bascule	Eleaf	that is the thing with the big chans, lots of folk but the y have to be strictly modded or traffic becomes too high and support dissappears in the noise, anyway that is enough about off-topic subjects in here for now :)
