2011-11-12T06:26:00.000Z	bonhoffer	truepurple	did you search in software center?
2011-11-12T06:27:00.000Z	truepurple	bonhoffer	it is in software center, but it is tied to a older mplayer version. I just had a bunch of help installing a newer version of mplayer, I need a smplayer that points to it.
2011-11-12T06:28:00.000Z	bonhoffer	truepurple	can you install it from source?
2011-11-12T06:28:00.000Z	truepurple	bonhoffer	I don't even entirely know what that means
2011-11-12T06:29:00.000Z	bonhoffer	truepurple	o.k. i can't walk through it right now -- i have to run -- but google build from source on ubuntu
