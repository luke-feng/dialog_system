2011-02-13T22:14:00.000Z	HelgeSverre	BluesKaj	i have one. why is linux used so much for servers?
2011-02-13T22:15:00.000Z	BluesKaj	HelgeSverre	they are free or cheap and very efficient
2011-02-13T22:17:00.000Z	BluesKaj	HelgeSverre	as well linux is based on the very mature unix OS , which has been around much longer then other OSs so thereby much more bug free.
