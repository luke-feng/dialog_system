2006-08-28T11:54:00.000Z	bm0nk		I'm just about to switch from xp to ubuntu...got a couple questions though if anyone doesnt mind dealing with a noob :P
2006-08-28T11:55:00.000Z	bm0nk		Well, I have 3 drives, C: which is OS/files, and 2 others for storage....all are NTFS....
2006-08-28T11:55:00.000Z	bm0nk		I'm assuming the easiest way to do this is just to burn all my music and stuff, and reformat them to fat32?
2006-08-28T11:56:00.000Z	bm0nk		I'm wondering if...files stored on a ntfs drive....if you then moved them to a FAT32 drive....the file type is nothing to do with the storage system right?
