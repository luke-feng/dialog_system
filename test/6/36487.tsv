2009-05-28T20:32:00.000Z	juiceman5000		So here's a question; I recently switched to Ubuntu from Windows, and so far, it's been awesome, but my sound card does not want to play nicely. What is the best sound card build/model IYO for linux boxes
2009-05-28T20:33:00.000Z	coz_	juiceman5000	 whoa that is a difficult question   sound blasters seems to work out of the box  and if you are having issues  go to #alsa channel    they may be able to help with that particular card
2009-05-28T20:34:00.000Z	juiceman5000	coz_	i need an upgrade anywho, so i'm really just looking for a model that won't give me too much grief
2009-05-28T20:34:00.000Z	juiceman5000		so soundblaster it is; seems like the obvious safe choice
2009-05-28T20:35:00.000Z	coz_	juiceman5000	 is generally is but I would still go to #alsa  they may be able to get the card you have up and running
