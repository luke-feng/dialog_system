2008-09-22T10:25:00.000Z	OoRal		Why does this happen every time?! Shortly after I install, usually a few days, any music decides not to work and to freeze ANY PLAYER I try to play it in. What the heck is wrong with it?
2008-09-22T10:25:00.000Z	OoRal		Does anyone have ANY clue?
2008-09-22T10:25:00.000Z	OoRal		I said it was working for a few days, JaseX.
2008-09-22T10:27:00.000Z	OoRal		I also said it was MUSIC.
2008-09-22T10:28:00.000Z	OoRal		I wouldn't be getting angry if people listened to me
