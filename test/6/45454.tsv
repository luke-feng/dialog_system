2008-12-22T22:07:00.000Z	mekr	dr_willis	ill create a new partition, may i choose logical or primary?
2008-12-22T22:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	mekr	 linux can use either one.
2008-12-22T22:09:00.000Z	mekr	dr_willis	whats the difference?
2008-12-22T22:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	mekr	 disk partiioning basics.. check google/wiki pages.. In short. You can have 4 Primary Partitions per disk.. One can be  an Extended partition that holds Logicals...
