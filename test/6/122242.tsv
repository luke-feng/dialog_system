2006-03-23T14:02:00.000Z	cA1mAn		when will the team creat a live-cd for XUBUNTU?
2006-03-23T14:03:00.000Z	cA1mAn		xfce
2006-03-23T14:04:00.000Z	cA1mAn		xfce rules :-)
2006-03-23T14:05:00.000Z	cA1mAn		it would make much sense as a *live-cd", since it's so light-weight
2006-03-23T14:06:00.000Z	Munchkinguy	cA1mAn	You can get an xfce live cd here: http://www.xfld.de/Xfld/en/index.html
