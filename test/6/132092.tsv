2009-03-03T23:36:00.000Z	LegendaryDarkKni		Hello, people i need a little help. I run Ubuntu 8.10 Desktop and i want to set up an VPN connection, having ethernet connection working, and with admininstrator rights. Add button seems to be disabled. Thanks beforehand
2009-03-03T23:38:00.000Z	LegendaryDarkKni		hey... Help please...
2009-03-03T23:39:00.000Z	LegendaryDarkKni		In the connections window... You know, accessible trough tray (or whatever is it called properly, i switched just yesterday)
2009-03-03T23:41:00.000Z	LegendaryDarkKni		Will try.... Apt-get is acting somewhat strange, though, it does not even install aplications listed in help file
2009-03-03T23:42:00.000Z	LegendaryDarkKni		where is this /etc?
2009-03-03T23:44:00.000Z	LjL	LegendaryDarkKni	just try typing "sudo apt-get install openvpn", then your VPN-related button in the network config applet might get enabled
