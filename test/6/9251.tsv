2012-11-02T02:02:00.000Z	bennis		hey, i'm trying to make a bootable usb on windows using the latest unetbootin... I've formatted my drive to fat32, the windows standard. It's not booting... What is windows doing wrong?
2012-11-02T02:03:00.000Z	guntbert	bennis	firts question: did you set up booting from USB? (in BIOS)?
2012-11-02T02:05:00.000Z	guntbert	bennis	2nd question: does it boot from the stick at all (with errors) ?
2012-11-02T02:05:00.000Z	bennis	guntbert	No, i'm getting a "remove all disks then push any button to reboot" error
2012-11-02T02:06:00.000Z	guntbert	bennis	that message comes at the end of a live CD/USB session
2012-11-02T02:06:00.000Z	bennis	guntbert	couldn't tell you why i'm getting it then
