2011-11-07T04:54:00.000Z	zruty	bastidrazor	Thanks! That si doing something... I enevr even knew about that. That I had to go to sources.list or something...
2011-11-07T04:54:00.000Z	bastidrazor	zruty	software sources makes changes to your sources.list for you. there is a GUI way to almost everything now.
2011-11-07T04:59:00.000Z	zruty	bastidrazor	So I notice.... I would have been okay to do it in sources.list directly except that I do not know the names of all those servers. The GUI has that list, I see. And can test which one works best. Cool!
2011-11-07T04:59:00.000Z	bastidrazor	zruty	correct. software sources will ping each server and offer you the fastest ping.
