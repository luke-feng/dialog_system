2006-01-09T11:25:00.000Z	Xenguy	Jowi	thanks (tho I would prefer to configure this at some 'non-X' level ideally)
2006-01-09T11:25:00.000Z	Jowi	Xenguy	of course :)
2006-04-26T07:36:00.000Z	Jowi	Xenguy	you can delete .gnome2 and gnome2_private folders in your home directory. but that will make all your settings reset
2006-04-26T07:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	Jowi	that's what I want :-)  I'll try that
2006-04-29T06:07:00.000Z	Jowi	Xenguy	well, since DRI need DRM to work maybe it IS the number of the beast (a longshot I know and a tiny bit offtopic)
