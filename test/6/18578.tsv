2011-04-27T12:41:00.000Z	rumpe1	delby	well... there are many ways to accomplish this, but it would be a good idea to determine what is causing the problem.
2011-04-27T12:42:00.000Z	rumpe1	delby	well...for the installation itself it uses the open drivers (afaik)
2011-04-27T12:45:00.000Z	rumpe1	delby	well... i guess you could use other drivers via kernel parameters ..hm
