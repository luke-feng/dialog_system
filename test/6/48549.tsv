2008-11-02T20:24:00.000Z	Tatster		Hi all.  Just upgraded from 8.04 to 8.10 - I get my login screen as normal and can select user, but after that I just get a black screen with only a mouse pointer, nothing else.   Any ideas what I can do ?
2008-11-02T20:24:00.000Z	kke	Tatster	uninstall compiz
2008-11-02T20:25:00.000Z	Tatster	kke	Is there a way I can break-down to a terminal so I can uninstall compiz ?
2008-11-02T20:25:00.000Z	kke	Tatster	ctrl-alt-f1 or boot in recovery mode
2008-11-02T20:26:00.000Z	kke	Tatster	also remove compiz-core
2008-11-02T20:31:00.000Z	Tatster	kke	Thanks for the info - it worked a treat
