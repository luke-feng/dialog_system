2005-09-22T08:20:00.000Z	ndazza	sproingie	like the changed font paths? ;)
2005-09-22T08:20:00.000Z	sproingie	ndazza	yep that was a killer.  also the int10 extension interferes fatally with fglrx
2005-09-22T08:21:00.000Z	sproingie	ndazza	things like that.  small changes, but the system's practically dead til they're made
2005-09-22T08:21:00.000Z	ndazza	sproingie	lucky i never got fglrx working properly :)
2005-09-22T08:21:00.000Z	sproingie	ndazza	i just did about an hour ago
