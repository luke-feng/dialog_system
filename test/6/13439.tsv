2011-01-16T19:20:00.000Z	jrib	angieanni	you avoid doing so.  What program do you want to install exactly?
2011-01-16T19:22:00.000Z	angieanni	jrib	fmtools-1.0.2
2011-01-16T19:22:00.000Z	jrib	angieanni	do you know about APT?
2011-01-16T19:22:00.000Z	angieanni	jrib	not much
2011-01-16T19:23:00.000Z	jrib	angieanni	to install software on ubuntu you should always use the repositories either using apt-get on the command line or a gui frontend like synaptic or Add/Remove Programs.  I'll have ubottu send you more info about this.  For example, to install fmtools, you can do in the terminal: sudo apt-get install fmtools
