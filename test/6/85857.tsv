2007-07-04T14:54:00.000Z	Billy		Ya I love Ubuntu  I have deleted windows off of 3 of my box's ... the only problem I have is that I am not able to play my IToons M4p files and I can not hear the sound of .rm files
2007-07-04T14:56:00.000Z	DerangedDingo	Billy	Itunes store bought mp4 files are encrypted and can't be read. with the help of Gstreamer plugins or additional media players you might be able to play the regular ITunes converted files
