2008-10-28T15:59:00.000Z	jrib	Maeva	wfm on amd64 with flash10.  It takes a couple of seconds to play after clicking the play button.  Did you try waiting a bit so it can buffer?
2008-10-28T16:01:00.000Z	Maeva	jrib	YEs i waited nothing happens
2008-10-28T16:03:00.000Z	jrib	Maeva	right now, does youtube work ok?
2008-10-28T16:06:00.000Z	jrib	Maeva	don't know then, the site is working fine for me and if you get a play button and then after clicking it just a solid black screen then that's exactly what happens here except the video starts after a few seconds of black
