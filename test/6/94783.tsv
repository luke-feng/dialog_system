2010-01-04T06:57:00.000Z	Ricket	scunizi	ubuntu server doesn't have a system>admin>synaptic :)
2010-01-04T06:57:00.000Z	scunizi	Ricket	ah.. server.. use aptitude
2010-01-04T06:58:00.000Z	Ricket	scunizi	ooo but thanks for reminding me about XBMC!! i should definitely check that one out
2010-01-04T06:58:00.000Z	scunizi	Ricket	it's gui based though.. you can add the gui to server with sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
