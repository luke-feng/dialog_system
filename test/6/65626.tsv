2009-10-31T10:54:00.000Z	jbuncher	DaveyAM	install the compizconfig-settings-manager, play around in there.
2009-10-31T10:55:00.000Z	jbuncher	DaveyAM	that's why I said to install the settings-manager, so that you can go in and really tweak things, such as turning on the cube
2009-10-31T10:57:00.000Z	jbuncher	DaveyAM	should just be in the repositories, though it might be in universe.
2009-10-31T10:59:00.000Z	jbuncher	DaveyAM	what error?
2009-10-31T10:59:00.000Z	jbuncher	DaveyAM	Ah, yeah.  no idea.
