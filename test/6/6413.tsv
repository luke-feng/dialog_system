2011-09-19T15:41:00.000Z	graingert	iamsashka	firefox is not likely to be listening on any ports
2011-09-19T15:42:00.000Z	iamsashka	graingert	okay. as for pid learn port applications?
2011-09-19T15:45:00.000Z	graingert	iamsashka	why do you need that
2011-09-19T15:46:00.000Z	iamsashka	graingert	I have to find out on which port the application hangs
2011-09-19T15:46:00.000Z	graingert	iamsashka	I doubt that makes sense
