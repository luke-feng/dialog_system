2005-06-09T13:36:00.000Z	Highbie		this file of mine i downloaded somehow turned into a link, and i can't change it back and i can't access the file

2005-06-09T13:38:00.000Z	dooglus	Highbie	hit windows-r then type "cmd" and hit return.  you'll be in a 'shell' window (such as it is) where you can 'cd' to the directory and "rename" the file
2005-06-09T13:50:00.000Z	dooglus	Highbie	what does it say if you just run "rename" without arguments?  Or "rename/?"?
