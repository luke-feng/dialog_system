2005-11-09T10:29:00.000Z	brist0w		hello. anyone here from canada? any of you use shipit?
2005-11-09T10:31:00.000Z	brist0w		just wondering about how long ship-to-delivery takes. found out about it recently, ordered it, and was delayed because of the upcoming release. the order was handed off to the shipping company about 3 weeks ago, but it still hasn't arrived... wondering if that's typical or not
2005-11-09T10:32:00.000Z	brist0w		also, what's a decent-performing minimum config for an ubuntu system? if I can install it on a PIII-600 with 128M RAM, is that a decent machine, or should I be looking for something more muscular? should I inisit on more memory (a-la-windows :)?
2005-11-09T10:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	brist0w	I think they ship surface - cheaper - and I know it's shipped from Europe
2005-11-09T10:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	brist0w	Ubuntu is Debian
2005-11-09T10:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	brist0w	Debian is still Debian - Ubuntu is a fork (or a spoon, to some people) ;)
