2012-03-07T22:55:00.000Z	mosdef100200		ermm something like an autorun.inf for linux???
2012-03-07T22:55:00.000Z	mosdef100200		does that make sense?

2012-03-07T22:58:00.000Z	magicJ	mosdef100200	who is absolutely right - ME I ASSUME
2012-03-07T22:58:00.000Z	magicJ	mosdef100200	as previously asked - what do you want to do
