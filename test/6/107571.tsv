2006-11-17T16:47:00.000Z	ciphex		can anyone suggest a cheap PCI audio card that will work well under ubuntu dapper?
2006-11-17T16:48:00.000Z	crimsun	ciphex	sound blaster live (non-24-bit, non-7.1)
2006-11-17T16:48:00.000Z	ciphex		something of the soundblaster flavor?
2006-11-17T16:49:00.000Z	ciphex	crimsun	any ideas on a specific model... i did pick upo a soundblaster live but it won't do the trick. it's some odd model i guess
2006-11-17T16:49:00.000Z	crimsun	ciphex	avoid all 24-bit and 7.1 ones. Use one of the old ones.
