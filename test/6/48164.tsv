2009-09-03T11:59:00.000Z	xim_	lyrae	i think the find command will work, also gui from gnome-search-tool
2009-09-03T12:00:00.000Z	lyrae	xim_	i think find just searches for files
2009-09-03T12:01:00.000Z	xim_	lyrae	maybe right the gnome-search-tool will do it tho
2009-09-03T12:01:00.000Z	lyrae	xim_	ill try what ActionParsnip said first :)
2009-09-03T12:01:00.000Z	xim_	lyrae	yeah its good to be able to do it in terminal, i use gnome-search-tool alot tho i have it on my main panel ;p
