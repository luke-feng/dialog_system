2005-05-03T11:20:00.000Z	Remenic		not sure what it's good at though
2005-05-03T06:45:00.000Z	Remenic		I'm sure mister Albacker would still prefer acroread if it were opensource ;)
2005-05-03T06:47:00.000Z	Albacker	Remenic	well the problem isnt in the open or closed source. the problem in this case stands in "which is the best software" and ... mister isnt the right word for a 15 year old boy.
2005-05-03T06:48:00.000Z	Remenic	Albacker	I'm sorry little boy
2005-05-03T06:48:00.000Z	Albacker	Remenic	no problem.
