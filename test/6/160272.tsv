2006-04-07T16:52:00.000Z	PlantPerson		My disk says 1.8 GB minimum but the wiki says 10
2006-04-07T16:52:00.000Z	PlantPerson		which is correct
2006-04-07T16:53:00.000Z	PlantPerson		1.8 GB is the true minimum?
2006-04-07T16:54:00.000Z	fissy	PlantPerson	there's only one cd to ubuntu, they can't expand that to 10GB :D. However, what do you want to do after install? you need a little space free to install and run programs in, as well as space for your users
2006-04-07T16:57:00.000Z	fissy	PlantPerson	3GB?
