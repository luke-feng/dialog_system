2005-11-24T10:05:00.000Z	topyli	hellblade	new stable ubuntu is released every six months, no version upgrades in between
2005-11-24T10:05:00.000Z	topyli	hellblade	bug and security patches of course. just no new versions
2005-11-24T10:06:00.000Z	topyli	hellblade	i.e. it's stable
2005-11-24T10:07:00.000Z	topyli	hellblade	i used debian sid for a long time, but it was a bit tiresome to maintain. so i switched to ubuntu and i've been happy
2005-11-24T10:08:00.000Z	topyli	hellblade	not the binaries, but debian sources build very well on ubuntu
2005-11-24T10:08:00.000Z	topyli	hellblade	besides, ubuntu has just about everything that sid has, and some extra too
