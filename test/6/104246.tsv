2008-03-17T12:08:00.000Z	wantE17style		there is a way to display folder/subfolders/files/programs from left to right in 3 or 4 panes using one window - this is how OS X works as well as Enlightenment E17......can this be done in Gnomre????????
2008-03-17T12:10:00.000Z	wantE17style		no no, it's that Face in OS X you click on and you can view your folders or programs which appear to the right in another window
2008-03-17T12:10:00.000Z	wantE17style		yes.....maybe
2008-03-17T12:10:00.000Z	wantE17style		E17 has the same thing
