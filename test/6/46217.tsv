2008-12-06T03:32:00.000Z	isleshocky77		I don't know if it was a bad mount, but I now have a remnent directory left where I normally mount an external drive.  I can't delete it or ls. I get this: "ls: cannot access SDO Large: Input/output error"  Any ideas on how to get rid of it?
2008-12-06T03:32:00.000Z	isleshocky77		ls of it's parent directory returns a listing like this: "d?????????  ? ?    ?       ?                ? SDO Large"
