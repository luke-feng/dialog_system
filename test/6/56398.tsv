2009-06-06T00:35:00.000Z	neurobuntu	deagle	is it an old card?
2009-06-06T00:42:00.000Z	neurobuntu	deagle	 you can pipe the lsusb output to grep....:  lsusb | grep VGA    will show anylines with VGA in them
2009-06-06T00:43:00.000Z	neurobuntu	deagle	so use lsusb | grep <search_string_generally_a_few_short_letters>
2009-06-06T00:44:00.000Z	neurobuntu	deagle	sorry use lspci not lsusb
2009-06-06T00:44:00.000Z	neurobuntu	deagle	lspci | grep Audio
