2008-11-17T20:22:00.000Z	Lasivian		is there any easy way to send mails from software that does not have a field for an outgoing smtp password?
2008-11-17T20:22:00.000Z	Lasivian		ie. I need an open smtp server

2008-11-17T20:23:00.000Z	Lasivian	nibbler_	I tried that with postfix, but I get "relay access denied"
2008-11-17T20:24:00.000Z	nibbler_	Lasivian	then fix your config ;-)
2008-11-17T20:24:00.000Z	Lasivian	nibbler_	that's what i'm trying to do
