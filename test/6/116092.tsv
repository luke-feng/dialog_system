2007-05-01T10:14:00.000Z	Pelo	RememberPOL	 I am fairly sure that sudo apt-get upgrade will not upgrade a distro to the next release
2007-05-01T10:15:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Pelo	I never said it would, but it will upgrade his ubuntu release.
2007-05-01T10:15:00.000Z	Pelo	RememberPOL	 no it won't  it will upgrade the packages
2007-05-01T10:16:00.000Z	RememberPOL	Pelo	And the packages make up his release.
