2011-04-08T01:26:00.000Z	mitras2		I have a question:
2011-04-08T01:26:00.000Z	mitras2		I just set up Ubuntu and now I would like to route the default "Documents"-Folders onto my third partition.
2011-04-08T01:26:00.000Z	mitras2		I have tryed to erayse the bookmark inside nautilus and replace it with the new folder on the third partition, but Software like OpenOffice still wants so save the files to the "Documents"-Folder inside my User directory.
2011-04-08T01:26:00.000Z	mitras2		Can anyone tell me how not only to change the bookmark, but how to route the standart-"Documents"-Folder onto an other partition ?
