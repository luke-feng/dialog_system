2011-12-16T11:35:00.000Z	nac4l		why would "sh" produce different results than "./" when launching an application?  How can I identify where "./" points?
2011-12-16T11:35:00.000Z	nac4l		are there different flags that are hidden for ./ and sh
2011-12-16T11:36:00.000Z	nac4l		ah, I see
2011-12-16T11:36:00.000Z	nac4l		thank you guys
