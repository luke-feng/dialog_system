2009-08-15T07:42:00.000Z	tread		This is driving me crazy.  Yesterday, I plug in my USB device, and I can access it in /dev but not otherwise. Finally, I got it configured and working.  Then, since I rebooted, it doesn't even get listed in /dev when I plug it in :(  If anyone can help, I'd really appreciate it.
