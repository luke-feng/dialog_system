2012-06-27T21:52:00.000Z	i7c	Ufo13	why no live cd?
2012-06-27T21:53:00.000Z	i7c	Ufo13	if you can't even boot from a live cd anymore it'll be hard to find a solution here
2012-06-27T21:55:00.000Z	i7c	Ufo13	sounds like your live cd doesnt work properly? is it an usb stick or a cd?
2012-06-27T21:56:00.000Z	i7c	Ufo13	check the md5 hash sum of the iso file after downloading
2012-06-27T22:06:00.000Z	i7c	Ufo13	as somebody mentioned, try low burn speed
