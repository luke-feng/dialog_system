2008-04-05T04:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		pretty much

2008-04-05T04:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		there's still a lot of apps,etc that do not work in 64bit, as you've found out.
2008-04-05T04:41:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		the "latest greatest", isn't always the most stable
2008-04-05T04:41:00.000Z	unocrash	IndyGunFreak	is right, tylerflick.
