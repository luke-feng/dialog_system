2007-04-20T09:55:00.000Z	Shaddox		Is Feisty support still at #ubuntu+1?
2007-04-20T09:56:00.000Z	Shaddox		Okay, then I'll ask here. How do I copy a folder from my laptop to my server over an SSH connection onto my server as a sudo, so I can copy it to /usr/local/hlserver/ns ?

2007-04-20T09:58:00.000Z	Shaddox	Fujitsu	Can you explain how? I'm still a ubuntu nubcaek, and finally got Cedega working for my Steam and stuff.
