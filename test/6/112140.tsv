2006-07-23T09:48:00.000Z	sethk	schmakk	system settings, desktop appearance (or similar words)
2006-07-23T09:49:00.000Z	schmakk	sethk	been there... the kde desktop itself is fine, like the panel and icons, but inside programs its still weird
2006-07-23T09:50:00.000Z	sethk	schmakk	are you sure you checked everything in appearance?  there is a pull down box there for a bunch of different things, and each of those entries in the pull down has it's own font settings.
