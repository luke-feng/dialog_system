2006-04-30T05:57:00.000Z	crimsun	csmall	chomping at the bit, aintcha? We haven't even released Dapper yet.
2006-04-30T05:57:00.000Z	csmall	crimsun	no, being a seperate thing I figured it would have be out there somewhere for dev already
2006-04-30T05:58:00.000Z	crimsun	csmall	we don't open the next dev branch until the current one is released as stable.
2006-04-30T05:58:00.000Z	csmall	crimsun	sure, I understand that. But I unstood edgy to be a seperate project of sorts
2006-04-30T05:58:00.000Z	crimsun	csmall	it's only a codename for our next version.
