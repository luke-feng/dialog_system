2008-09-21T02:15:00.000Z	wiehan	guntbert	thanks for correcting me, but as it states in your link it doesn't really matter... but I'll use and advise gksudo from now on
2008-09-21T02:17:00.000Z	guntbert	wiehan	didn't want to "correct" you :)
2009-12-23T13:18:00.000Z	guntbert	wiehan	my first thought: a memory stick gone bad - run memtest
2009-12-23T13:19:00.000Z	guntbert	wiehan	but be sure to run the complete test (most errors only show up late in the process)
