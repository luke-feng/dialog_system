2007-11-28T22:46:00.000Z	ochosi		hi, since two days or so my laptops somethimes locks up during bootup. actually it locks up while loading the xserver, i would say. both keyboard and mouse are dead and my numlock and capslock are blinking - any idea what this could mean?
2007-11-28T22:46:00.000Z	ochosi		(also my Xorg.log is a lot shorter when bootup isn't achieved as to when bootup is completed
2007-11-28T22:46:00.000Z	Rautamiekka	ochosi	I dare to say that there is problem with the kernel
2007-11-28T22:47:00.000Z	Rautamiekka	ochosi	I've compiled kernel myself but without initrd it doesn't work so I fucked it up
2007-11-28T22:48:00.000Z	ochosi	Rautamiekka	i have the standard kernel, didn't compile one myself. the only thing that could have messed up something was i didn't have any free space on my root a few days ago (this actually caused the system to do pretty strange things...)
2007-11-28T22:49:00.000Z	ochosi	Rautamiekka	i had a look into kern.log but nothing too helpful there. any suggestions?
