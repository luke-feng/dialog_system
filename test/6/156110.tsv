My problem is that I cannot get the NVIDIA driver to install. I have tried it twice and had to reinstall the OS both times to get back into GNOME. I followed the instructions on ubuntuguide and everything seemed to go ok but when I rebooted only a third of the login screen loaded and the rest was white. Needless
2005-05-25T12:53:00.000Z	matt_de_noob		to say I could not log on! Is the nvidia driver compatable with Ubuntu? Phew! Long qestion I know!
2005-05-25T12:54:00.000Z	matt_de_noob		great.
