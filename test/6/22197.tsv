2010-04-18T10:57:00.000Z	goodfella121		Well, I was wondering. I have an integrated 64mb video card, and I'm getting ready to install a 256mb video card. Will this improve video editing performance in Ubuntu (Kdenlive, PiTiVi and OpenShot)?

2010-04-18T11:02:00.000Z	goodfella121		Tucemiux: Already did. Sorry man, lol, no one answered. Also, I'm about to double the ram. It already runs near smooth with little lag on 1GB ram (only on Linux!) and a 64mb vid card, so I know this will solve a lot of problems.
