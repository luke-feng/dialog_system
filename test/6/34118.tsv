2009-07-26T17:14:00.000Z	nperry	Keiffer	You need to upgrade to thunderbird3.0 (which is in beta)
2009-07-26T17:15:00.000Z	Keiffer	nperry	so the stable version don't have this function...?
2009-07-26T17:16:00.000Z	Keiffer		No. Only in Mozilla
2009-07-26T17:16:00.000Z	nperry	Keiffer	No, only the beta
2009-07-26T17:16:00.000Z	nperry	Keiffer	But seems pretty stable to me
