2011-10-31T12:03:00.000Z	yagoo	tharaka	you said grub still works after?
2011-10-31T12:04:00.000Z	yagoo	tharaka	that's your problem.
2011-10-31T12:05:00.000Z	yagoo	tharaka	call hp
2011-10-31T12:12:00.000Z	yagoo	tharaka	a server is not to be rebooted.. so what's the big deal here? You're trying to restore factory defaults? CALL HP.
2011-10-31T12:13:00.000Z	yagoo	tharaka	they'll laugh at you because you wiped out your hp recovery partition with linux
