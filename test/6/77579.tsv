2012-10-19T21:26:00.000Z	kingfisher64		i'm used to format option being present within a cd boot setup
2012-10-19T21:26:00.000Z	bazhang	kingfisher64	from the live cd?
2012-10-19T21:26:00.000Z	bazhang	kingfisher64	dual boot or no
2012-10-19T21:26:00.000Z	bazhang	kingfisher64	then just choose to overwrite it all
2012-10-19T22:29:00.000Z	bazhang	kingfisher64	there are many variables involved with that: ram cpu etc hard to say
