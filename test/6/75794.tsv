2007-10-20T03:46:00.000Z	garu		what is the best app to burn Iso's in ubuntu?k3b is taking forever just to erase a cd-rw!
2007-10-20T03:46:00.000Z	Stormx2	garu	I'd say k3b is the best. You might need to turn dma on...
2007-10-20T03:47:00.000Z	garu	Stormx2	how do I do that?turn dma on?
2007-10-20T03:49:00.000Z	garu	Stormx2	that's for 6.06 right?
2007-10-20T03:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	garu	it'll work on other versions...
2007-10-20T03:49:00.000Z	garu	Stormx2	its ok, just finished erasing it...thanks ;)
