2009-08-15T18:32:00.000Z	grawity	bobg	I dual-boot Windows :) Sometimes, if the .exe just extracts things to a floppy, I use another computer.

2009-08-15T18:35:00.000Z	grawity	bobg	What exactly are you updating?
2009-08-15T18:36:00.000Z	grawity	bobg	If Windows gets pure unrestricted access to that particular device - then yes, it probably would work.
