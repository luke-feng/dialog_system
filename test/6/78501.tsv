2007-12-06T07:26:00.000Z	kelsin	rpj8	you might need to run "xrdb -load .Xdefaults"
2007-12-06T07:26:00.000Z	kelsin	rpj8	and I think the new place for this is .Xresources
2007-12-06T07:26:00.000Z	rpj8	kelsin	I see. So I should dump my stuff in .Xresources then
2007-12-06T07:27:00.000Z	kelsin	rpj8	I think so, I think Xdefaults was dropped a while ago, the main issue is without restarting your xsession I'm pretty sure you have to run that command on the file
