2009-12-20T02:10:00.000Z	rob_p	kashhh	Why Ubuntu, of course!  :-)
2009-12-20T02:10:00.000Z	kashhh	rob_p	ok, but many people have been saying i should try Fedora
2009-12-20T02:12:00.000Z	rob_p	kashhh	In reality, Linux is Linux.  There are subtle differences among the various distros but when you know one, you know them all.  It comes down to how much experience you have with Linux, as to which one you should start with.
