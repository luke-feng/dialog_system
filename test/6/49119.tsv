2008-11-20T07:55:00.000Z	PassionFRUI7E	raven	Just make a nautilus script to do it.
2008-11-20T07:55:00.000Z	PassionFRUI7E	raven	You're thinking in windows mode.
2008-11-20T07:55:00.000Z	PassionFRUI7E	raven	Then you right click and could extract all archives in said folder to current directory.
2008-11-20T07:58:00.000Z	PassionFRUI7E	raven	Check drivers?
