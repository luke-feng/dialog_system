2012-02-11T23:34:00.000Z	mongy	acicula	I kind of need it to be used as default gateway.  In windows its used as default as well.  I guess it's not doable in my situation.  thx
2012-02-11T23:35:00.000Z	acicula	mongy	if it is your default gateway then it should break any current connections you have
2012-02-11T23:36:00.000Z	mongy	acicula	I guessed it would, but it doesnt affect them in windows, no idea why
2012-02-11T23:36:00.000Z	acicula	mongy	either windows tracks the connection, or it does not set the default gateway properly
2012-02-11T23:37:00.000Z	mongy	acicula	I thought it wasnt working properly in windows, but then I checked whatismyip and did other tests, it was default.
