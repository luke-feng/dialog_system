2007-12-31T21:10:00.000Z	Creationist	th0r	Yeah, that kinda pissed me off about Windows too... I can view any and all files on my Linux drives regardless of permissions.  Kind of defeats the purpose of security, doesn't it?
2007-12-31T21:12:00.000Z	Creationist	th0r	I'm just saying that I used to think my personal stuff was safe in Linux without my password.  But that's just no even close to true.  All you have to do is throw the drive into a Windows machine and boom... it's all accessible.
