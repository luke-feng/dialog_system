2006-04-24T12:31:00.000Z	Nrbelex		Hi, I have a few questions about users - Is the user created during setup the only user with administrative access (the only one able to install programs, etc.)?
2006-04-24T12:32:00.000Z	Nrbelex		Is it a securty issue if I regularly use this user for basic tasks (web browsing, etc.)?
2006-04-24T12:33:00.000Z	Nrbelex		Thanks again all
2006-04-24T12:34:00.000Z	Nrbelex		Ok - thanks a lot
