2008-09-04T05:31:00.000Z	Gnea	Lemont_Jones	i'm rather partial to vlc - but really, whatever you prefer is what will do.
2008-09-04T05:31:00.000Z	Lemont_Jones	Gnea	oh I have that installed, but when I open it, I see no "play dvd" option
2008-09-04T05:32:00.000Z	Lemont_Jones	Gnea	oops, yep, its there --- play disc
2008-09-04T05:32:00.000Z	Lemont_Jones	Gnea	btw, i'm an r-tard
2008-09-04T05:33:00.000Z	Gnea	Lemont_Jones	we all are, at one point or another :)
