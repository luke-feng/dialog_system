2010-02-14T02:53:00.000Z	Oinkoinkoink		Ok, i have Mandriva and Windows 7 on my computer. Yesterday, i decided to erase Mandriva because i dont use it anymore.  So what i went and erase the partition. But when i wanted to start my computer today i got an Error 22 by Grub. So i went and download the Mandriva One cd. I boot but i cannot choose the rescue mode. I mean, i have 2 option, boot from harddrive or boot from cd. Help
