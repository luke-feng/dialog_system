2009-01-17T03:22:00.000Z	Stargazer		Hey guys, what's the command to logout in the terminal ?
2009-01-17T03:23:00.000Z	Slart	Stargazer	exit usually quits the active terminal.. you've tried logout, right?
2009-01-17T03:23:00.000Z	Stargazer	Slart	i'll try that now, thanks.
2009-01-17T03:24:00.000Z	Slart	Stargazer	also check the man page for shutdown.. perhaps there is a switch to make it logout instead
2009-01-18T01:21:00.000Z	Slart	Stargazer	df
2009-01-18T01:22:00.000Z	Slart	Stargazer	df -h is even better
