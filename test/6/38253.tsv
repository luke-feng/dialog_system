2009-07-15T22:03:00.000Z	Houba1986		hey, i have a question. i'm trying to copy folder contents from a folder on my desktop to usr/lib folder, but i keep getting permission denied. how do i change that? i am using ubuntu 9.04
2009-07-15T22:03:00.000Z	MaarekStele	Houba1986	add sudo in front of the copy command
2009-07-15T22:04:00.000Z	Houba1986	MaarekStele	but it's a lot of files, so i was wondering if theres a way to copy them all at once?
2009-07-15T22:04:00.000Z	MaarekStele	Houba1986	sudo cp *.*
2009-07-15T22:05:00.000Z	Houba1986	MaarekStele	so i type in sudo  cp *first folder*.*usr/lib*
2009-07-15T22:06:00.000Z	MaarekStele	Houba1986	look at what phisher1 said... cp -R dirname/* /new/dir
