2008-04-28T21:05:00.000Z	saito		modprobe ssb doesn't show anything
2008-04-28T21:05:00.000Z	saito		unless you mean something else (i'm a linux n00bie :r)
2008-04-28T21:06:00.000Z	saito		mmm
2008-04-28T21:06:00.000Z	saito		apparently i don't have greb (what ever that might be :P)
2008-04-28T21:07:00.000Z	bazhang	saito	grep not greb
