2008-02-26T02:41:00.000Z	Kemrin2		Does anyone know an option to start programs minimized?
2008-02-26T02:43:00.000Z	Kemrin2		I'm trying to make programs minimized on startup, what option do I add to their commands for that?
2008-02-26T02:45:00.000Z	Kemrin2		I know how to add them to startip, what I'm asking is how do I make them be minimized. Isn't there a command for that?
2008-02-26T02:46:00.000Z	Kemrin2		No one knows a terminal command for minimizing programs?
