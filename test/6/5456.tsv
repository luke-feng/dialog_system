2011-11-03T12:06:00.000Z	pixolin		hello. what is the name of the bubble help that pops up if I receive new e-mails, connect to a new wifi, receive twitter news ...?
2011-11-03T12:07:00.000Z	heoyea	pixolin	think is called notify-osd
2011-11-03T12:08:00.000Z	pixolin	heoyea	do you know by chance if I can change the settings to shorten the time it displays messages?
2011-11-03T12:08:00.000Z	pixolin		don't want to disable it but it's somewhat annoying if it shows up too long
2011-11-03T12:08:00.000Z	heoyea	pixolin	i believe there was a tool to customize it, if u google a bit on that
2011-11-03T12:10:00.000Z	pixolin	heoyea	thanks anyway, will google for that
