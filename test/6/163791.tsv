2005-08-08T14:26:00.000Z	topyli	Y0Z	most X fonts on ubuntu seem to support utf8
2005-08-08T14:28:00.000Z	topyli	Y0Z	please don't paste those on the channel. we've all seen locales generated before
2005-08-08T14:30:00.000Z	topyli	Y0Z	the viewer doesn't use a suitable font. which viewer are you using?
