2007-06-21T12:20:00.000Z	unfo	Jason_P	because we want to help everyone equally.
2007-06-21T12:21:00.000Z	unfo	Jason_P	when people start breaking off into PM, then trolling is harder to prevent.  Also, when things go on in public, more people can read and learn.
2007-06-21T12:22:00.000Z	unfo	Jason_P	did you try reading the excellent documentation on the ubuntu website?
