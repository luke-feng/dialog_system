2009-09-26T21:28:00.000Z	Kuifje111	mo0nykit	all right.
2009-09-26T21:29:00.000Z	Kuifje111	mo0nykit	that could be the issue, because the errors occurred when I installed new RAM. I did run memtest though and it gave me no errors on this RAM.
2009-09-26T21:32:00.000Z	mo0nykit	Kuifje111	I see. I'm sorry I couldn't help any further. That's the best I know so far.
2009-09-26T21:32:00.000Z	Kuifje111	mo0nykit	thanks for the information.
2009-09-26T21:32:00.000Z	mo0nykit	Kuifje111	no problem
