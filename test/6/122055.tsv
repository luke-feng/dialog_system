2006-03-26T11:45:00.000Z	Hexidigital		do you guys think it is really worth the effort to try to update to firefox 1.5?  i tried it yesterday, and ended up reinstalling my system today... i dont want to have to do that twice... what do you think?

2006-03-26T11:46:00.000Z	Hexidigital	GnarusLeo	all i really wanted it for was to install some cool extensions... you think i should wait then? or is 1.5 a necessity?
2006-03-26T11:47:00.000Z	GnarusLeo	Hexidigital	well, its much faster and has extensions indeed, but installing it can be kind of tricky ... but the site given by ubotu helped me
