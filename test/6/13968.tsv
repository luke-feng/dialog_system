2011-01-03T01:09:00.000Z	spencer	msandoy	so the chip is toast, no way to recover it?
2011-01-03T01:10:00.000Z	msandoy	spencer	There might be special software around, but I have actually never had any luck recovering from damaged storage devices. There might be others in here who knows more about that.
2011-01-03T01:11:00.000Z	spencer	msandoy	alright, but so medium read error means that the chip is more than likely toast?
2011-01-03T01:12:00.000Z	msandoy	spencer	it means that there are errors on the medium.
2011-01-03T01:14:00.000Z	msandoy	spencer	Those errors might have come as a result of your phone crashing. The chip might still be ok if you format it. But I guess you are interrested in the content. :-)
