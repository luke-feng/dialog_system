2009-09-09T02:42:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ghost781	i use partedmagic live cd..
2009-09-09T02:43:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ghost781	partedmagic is a bit different.. its not Partition magic.. google it.. its a little better than Gparted IMO, but both will get the jo done
2009-09-09T02:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ghost781	if you have a live cd of Gparted, it will be fine, I just like partedmagic, cuz it actually has some networking tools, etc. and i surf the net while big drives are partitionining, rather than sitting around being bored
2009-09-09T02:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ghost781	well, you could jut use the Ubuntu Live CD... and install Gparted on it, and use it to partition the drive, and still surf the net, etc.. while it partitions.. but.. the system can sometiems be slow while doing all that
2009-09-09T02:47:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ghost781	don't worry about it, some folks just like to feel like they are somebody, just don't be blatant about it.
