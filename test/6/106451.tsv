2007-09-29T06:25:00.000Z	momal	cwillu	yeah i know but he has it in folder and it is easer for him to type NVIDIA*.run rather then NVIDIA-Linux-x86-100.14.19-pkg1.run
2007-09-29T06:26:00.000Z	cwillu	momal	hence why I mentioned the use of completion :p
2007-09-29T06:26:00.000Z	momal	cwillu	ahh didn't see the second line :p
2007-09-29T06:36:00.000Z	cwillu	momal	shiznit, do I really need to melt your computers?
