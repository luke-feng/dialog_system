2005-04-22T07:11:00.000Z	floater		where can I disable ESD sound drivers from not starting up everytime I reboot ?
2005-04-22T07:12:00.000Z	SeamusLP	floater	 I think I did it by killall esd and then saving my session on logout
2005-04-22T07:13:00.000Z	floater	SeamusLP	thanks! I'll try that
2005-04-22T07:41:00.000Z	floater	SeamusLP	The ESD was back up using my system after I rebooted and had tagged the "save current setup" ..any idea why?
2005-04-22T07:42:00.000Z	SeamusLP	floater	wait I have an idea
2005-04-22T07:42:00.000Z	SeamusLP	floater	I know there's some config menu where you can enable/disable the sound daemon, let me find it
