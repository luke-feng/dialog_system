2007-11-15T08:24:00.000Z	sfire	_boysdontcry	I've seen no linux software to do lightscribe.. there could be some now.. but wasn't before
2007-11-15T08:25:00.000Z	_boysdontcry	sfire	: do u think Sony DRU835 Int. 18X is supported?
2007-11-15T08:25:00.000Z	sfire	_boysdontcry	I'm sure the drive should work fine
2007-11-15T08:28:00.000Z	sfire	_boysdontcry	that just means you won't be able to burn lightscribe labels
2007-11-15T08:28:00.000Z	sfire	_boysdontcry	the drive itself will still work
