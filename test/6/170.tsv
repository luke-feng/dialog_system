2004-10-29T10:26:00.000Z	SepheeBear		anyone know if Ubuntu's gnome-vfs has got dns-sd enabled? i installed howl and configured mDNSresponder but it still doesnt want to pick up any Panther ftp servers.
2004-10-29T10:27:00.000Z	jdub	SepheeBear	nup, it doesn't
2004-10-29T10:28:00.000Z	SepheeBear	jdub	i think you're right
2004-10-29T10:31:00.000Z	jdub	SepheeBear	not really. most of that is gnome-level stuff.
2004-10-29T10:32:00.000Z	jdub	SepheeBear	we'll be shipping howl and so on in hoary
2004-10-29T10:39:00.000Z	jdub	SepheeBear	a new nss module (or both)
