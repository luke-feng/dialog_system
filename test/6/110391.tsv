2009-12-01T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	piperfan	What is the problem your getting?
2009-12-01T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	piperfan	as far as I know there isn't really any  Desktop Linux support from SIS
2009-12-01T03:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	piperfan	and it would be  rather difficult for the  Desktop Linux developers to reverse enginer something
2009-12-01T03:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	piperfan	for SIS
