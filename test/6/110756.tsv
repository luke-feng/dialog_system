2006-11-09T11:18:00.000Z	OMF		do i have to modify the script, or can i resolve this another way
2006-11-09T11:18:00.000Z	SanityInAnarchy	OMF	 apt-get install make
2006-11-09T11:19:00.000Z	SanityInAnarchy	OMF	 or what Konnektion said
2006-11-09T11:24:00.000Z	SanityInAnarchy	OMF	 other than build-essential? I don't know, check what it's asking for
2006-11-09T11:24:00.000Z	SanityInAnarchy	OMF	 I assume you're trying to compile something from scratch, you'll probably have to install libxxx-dev if it says it can't find xxx
