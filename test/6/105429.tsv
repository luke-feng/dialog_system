2008-02-16T16:32:00.000Z	Dermooni		is there a decent IRC client for ubuntu? I tried xchat and using Konversation now, but I miss a client with a "perform" feature (as in mIRC)
2008-02-16T16:34:00.000Z	Dermooni		anyone?
2008-02-16T16:34:00.000Z	ifireball	Dermooni	what does "perform" do exactly?
2008-02-16T16:37:00.000Z	ifireball	Dermooni	Xchat has a "connect command" feature, you can even make it run a whole script file there
2008-02-16T16:39:00.000Z	ifireball	Dermooni	Konversation probably has a comparable feature, I don't use it though
2008-02-16T16:39:00.000Z	ifireball	Dermooni	 xchat irc typically has more advanced features then  xchat-GNOME irc
