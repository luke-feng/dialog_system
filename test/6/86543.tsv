2009-08-14T23:34:00.000Z	nanotube	Zxcvb	stop moving it around?
2009-08-14T23:34:00.000Z	nanotube	Zxcvb	:P
2009-08-14T23:35:00.000Z	Zxcvb	nanotube	the problem is that my bluetooth mouse is too fast and hard to control, though the touchpad is fine
2009-08-14T23:36:00.000Z	nanotube	Zxcvb	yea, i figured - just could'n resist making a joke. :) sorry i don't know how to do that ...
