2007-12-13T08:38:00.000Z	NotSoGutsy	zenrium	:: as I see, system monitor doesn't show *what processes* are making it higher, just that it is higher
2007-12-13T08:41:00.000Z	NotSoGutsy	zenrium	:: perhaps I'm missing something, then, as I have a total of 3 processes above 1% CPU usage [one being the system monitor], and my load average is 8.84
