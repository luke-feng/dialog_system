2011-02-16T20:32:00.000Z	vega-	BlueEagle	no, not just the kernel, also other packages
2011-02-16T20:32:00.000Z	BlueEagle	vega-	Oh. Well I did not know that. :)
2011-02-16T20:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle	vega-	Well they could have listed the services that had been updated and allowed you to just restart those.
2011-02-16T20:39:00.000Z	vega-	BlueEagle	that's my point exactly yeah, instead of rebooting ..
