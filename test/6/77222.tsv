2012-08-13T15:59:00.000Z	dfour		I'm trying to install Ubuntu and having a bit of trouble, is this a good place for help? or maybe you're really just a bot ;-)
2012-08-13T16:01:00.000Z	dfour		Ok, it's my first time with linux so i'm a bit lost. i tried to install with a cd but it kept freezing when i would run it without the cd so i tried with a usb. first, it gave me an error message, then after trying some of the suggestions on the forum here, it installed fine but now freezes at the purple screen as had happened before
2012-08-13T16:01:00.000Z	dfour		i have a toshiba sateliite-a135, intel pentium dual-core processor
2012-08-13T16:02:00.000Z	dfour		<bazhang> what's md5?
2012-08-13T16:04:00.000Z	dfour		ok, i verified it and it said it was fine. i'm going to try the nomdeset solution and see if that works
2012-08-13T16:04:00.000Z	bazhang	dfour	if that fails, consider the alternate installer
