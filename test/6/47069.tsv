2010-10-29T10:15:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	jc__	what's in it? did you try a knife? this is a computer forum by the way, if you need help opening a box you should go to the offtopic channel
2010-10-29T10:17:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	jc__	oh, I didn't realize we had a language barrier. that post was supposed to be a joke
