2007-08-02T08:10:00.000Z	DWSR	skyfalcon866	Yes, but you'll need to do a minimal install.
2007-08-02T08:11:00.000Z	DWSR	skyfalcon866	When I said minimal install, I meant you can't be installing very many programs, if any.
2007-08-02T08:12:00.000Z	DWSR	skyfalcon866	No, use a linux live CD.
2007-08-02T08:22:00.000Z	DWSR	skyfalcon866	No.
