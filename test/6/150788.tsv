2005-04-18T10:36:00.000Z	samuel_	andrewski	im not a fan of KDE... i guess its just a personal thing... sorry...
2005-04-18T10:37:00.000Z	andrewski	samuel_	no problem, i don't use it either.  i was just wondering why you were so happy it's not installed.  was it before?  did you come from another distro?
2005-04-18T10:39:00.000Z	samuel_	andrewski	the first distro i tried a looooong time ago was mandrake... didnt like it then... dont like it now
2005-04-18T10:39:00.000Z	andrewski	samuel_	i wondered.  me too. :)
