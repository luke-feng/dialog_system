2011-12-03T18:32:00.000Z	cipherboy	tommylommykins	sorry, only run old AMD hardware, so not sure. Did it not work on this version?
2011-12-03T18:33:00.000Z	tommylommykins	cipherboy	No, it completely broke. I was told to ome back when AMD released new hardware.
2011-12-03T18:34:00.000Z	tommylommykins		I don't know if this has happened, and even if it has, I want personal testimonial before I spend the afternoon installing
