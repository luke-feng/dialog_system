2009-03-07T22:01:00.000Z	daftykins	tony426	you tried "dust" from "community-themes" ?
2009-03-07T22:01:00.000Z	daftykins		only thing i've seen it mess up is certificate info pages in firefox
2009-03-07T22:01:00.000Z	daftykins		slightly hard to read
2009-03-07T22:01:00.000Z	daftykins		still possible though
2009-03-07T22:01:00.000Z	tony426	daftykins	no, i'll give it a shot but every dark one i've tried has had something screwed up
