2009-01-04T03:53:00.000Z	guntbert	wj32	because the app is running on one machine (the X-client) and using the "console" on the other machine (aka X-Server) for UI
2009-01-04T03:53:00.000Z	wj32	guntbert	ah i see
2009-01-04T03:55:00.000Z	guntbert	wj32	he doesn't need an X-Server on the remote machine, just X-Apps
2009-01-04T03:55:00.000Z	wj32	guntbert	no usr13 suggested vnc which wouldn't work without x server on the ubuntu server machine
