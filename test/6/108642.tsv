2006-10-23T14:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wikijeff	 if you are in rescue mode logged in as root. use startx
2006-10-23T14:20:00.000Z	wikijeff	Dr_willis	is rescue mode the same as recovery mode?
2006-10-23T14:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	wikijeff	 its booting to single user mode.. they just use silly names for them
