2008-04-28T06:31:00.000Z	dodimar		Grub erro 18, i'm getting pretty upset right now when all of the chatrooms  i go to don't give me an answer and the forums is no help...
2008-04-28T06:32:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	dodimar	i think error 18 means the partition can't be found, but i'm not too sure.
2008-04-28T06:33:00.000Z	dodimar	DefineKThyne	it is working fine before.. i fresh install ubuntu.. and now it is not working...
2008-04-28T06:37:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	dodimar	i encountered mine when i removed my linux from my computer at work, i don't know much about grub and i'm having some issues with it myself.
2008-04-28T06:38:00.000Z	dodimar		maybe my problem is not really important... well if I can't boot to ubuntu. there is no more reason on using it... after this day, if I won't be able to make it run, it's a goodbye. i need my system ASAP, tnx DefineKThyne for the response i hope you would be able to fix it...
2008-04-28T06:39:00.000Z	DefineKThyne	dodimar	have you tried another bootloader?
