2012-03-10T17:50:00.000Z	doomgiver		wait, did you guys say windows 7 is less crashy and faster than linux?
2012-03-10T17:50:00.000Z	doomgiver		then please explain how i can get 10 second boots with a optimized arch build?
2012-03-10T17:51:00.000Z	crizzy	doomgiver	win7 never crashes on me, ubuntu/unity/regular desktop apps on linux on the other hand crash 5 to 50 times / day
