2008-04-23T02:01:00.000Z	Pelo	undecim	won't it just rescan my FS from scratch when i search ?
2008-04-23T02:02:00.000Z	undecim	Pelo	I don't know. I figured that was what tracker was for, to keep your file search database up to date
2008-04-23T02:02:00.000Z	Pelo	undecim	for the related tracker applet yes but I don'T expect for old cli commands like locate
2008-04-23T02:03:00.000Z	undecim	Pelo	Okay, scratch that. It doesn't make any difference with or without tracker when I search my comp for newly created files
