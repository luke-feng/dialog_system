2011-04-18T12:44:00.000Z	heyguise		I feel like an idiot asking this question. But how do i change my clock? I went into "Change system time" and did that but when ever i reboot it goes back
2011-04-18T12:46:00.000Z	damno	heyguise	did you try from the clock applet in the gnome panel?
2011-04-18T12:47:00.000Z	heyguise	damno	yeah
2011-04-18T12:47:00.000Z	heyguise		i think its set to automatically get the time, but i have it set for the wrong time zone. but im not sure how to change the time zone.
2011-04-18T12:47:00.000Z	damno	heyguise	changed the time from therer?
2011-04-18T12:47:00.000Z	damno	heyguise	and still doesnt work?
