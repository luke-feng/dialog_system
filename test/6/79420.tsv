2008-08-14T12:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Scarey	The problem is after they say "does anyone know anything about [this]" you someone has to ask you to give actual question, and then you have to respond.  Makes support take a lot longer,
2008-08-14T12:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Scarey	Also makes people who glance in ocassionally less likely to be able to answer your question, because they have to be around to ask you to actually ask, and then around when you reply to actually read the question
2008-08-14T12:37:00.000Z	Scarey	Flannel	I see your point but you also argue against human nature (the good one) where it's polite to do as most do, rather than just enter a room and ask a question.
2008-08-14T12:39:00.000Z	Scarey	Flannel	but perhaps in time at least a few ppl will have learned to do as requested but there'll always be new ppl who'll be making the same mistake and be corrected forever. Makes you think if it's worth the mention?
