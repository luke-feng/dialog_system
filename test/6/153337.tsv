2005-03-13T12:42:00.000Z	Gor1		Anyone wanna let me bounce a repository question off them?
2005-03-13T12:43:00.000Z	Gor1		I think I am missing something with synaptic
2005-03-13T12:44:00.000Z	Gor1		I made the edit's that are suggested on ubuntuguide.org
2005-03-13T12:44:00.000Z	Gor1		however I am not really seeing any changes as far as new versions of software go?
2005-03-13T12:45:00.000Z	Gor1		For instance, Gaim is now releasing 1.1.4, however Synaptic still shows 1.0.0.  Is this to be expected?
