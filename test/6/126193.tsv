2006-04-24T10:44:00.000Z	slavik	Kr4zy4p3	why not dl the ISO and burn it?
2006-04-24T10:46:00.000Z	slavik	Kr4zy4p3	very good, I did have a quirk with hotplug though
2006-04-24T11:01:00.000Z	slavik	Kr4zy4p3	it's a "ncurses" installer (graphics from text)
2006-04-24T11:03:00.000Z	slavik	Kr4zy4p3	Gnome is a desktop environment (the GUI to the OS)
