2010-03-27T08:00:00.000Z	stsm_		isnt xmms cli only?
2010-03-27T08:00:00.000Z	stsm_		and xmms2 GUI
2010-03-27T08:00:00.000Z	stsm_		replaced by audacious iirc?
2010-03-27T08:00:00.000Z	rww	stsm_	xmms is old and unsupported and GUI. xmms2 is a client/server-model replacement. audacious is a completely unconnected (except that they look and work similarly) other media player that we tend to recommend for ex-xmms users.
2010-03-27T08:01:00.000Z	stsm_	rww	airtonix  aaaah the other way around :) i remember using xmms a few years ago
