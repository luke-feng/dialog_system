2006-03-09T08:28:00.000Z	WildRabbit		But I'm not sure if I have a LiveCD or a Install CD.
2006-03-09T08:29:00.000Z	elkbuntu	WildRabbit	you'll find out when you boot up with it. one will ask you about server or default, the other wont :)
2006-03-09T08:29:00.000Z	WildRabbit	elkbuntu	and might I ask which does which?
2006-03-09T08:30:00.000Z	elkbuntu	WildRabbit	the install cd will ask if you want a server installation or a default installation
2006-03-09T08:30:00.000Z	WildRabbit	elkbuntu	thank you, I have that one
