2008-05-01T03:33:00.000Z	_paneb		i am going through the ntfs-3g guide and there are 2 methods described. do both use ntfs-3g? if not, how does the automatic method work?
2008-05-01T03:33:00.000Z	RyanPrior	_paneb	NTFS partitions are mounted by default now, and you can just use mount -t ntfs-3g I think.
2008-05-01T03:34:00.000Z	_paneb	RyanPrior	does the "automatic" method work as well as the ntfs-3g?
2008-05-01T03:34:00.000Z	_paneb	RyanPrior	for r/w
2008-05-01T03:35:00.000Z	RyanPrior	_paneb	When I plug in my NTFS-formatted external hard drive, it mounts right up with no fuss.
2008-05-01T03:35:00.000Z	_paneb	RyanPrior	ok
