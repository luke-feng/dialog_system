2007-02-28T17:09:00.000Z	rlj		i'm going to set up a simple samba file server also acting as a PDC. but apart from file serving over samba, it won't do other server duties. any reason why i should install the server edition of ubuntu rather than from the desktop cd? (i already have one of those). cause i will probably install a desktop environment on the system anyway because i want to be able to browse files and burn dvd backups easily

2007-02-28T17:10:00.000Z	mneptok	rlj	get the server CD and aptitude install xubuntu-desktop, imo
2007-02-28T17:11:00.000Z	rlj	mneptok	i'll remove ooo, no need for that
2007-02-28T17:20:00.000Z	mneptok	rlj	never tried. but the package system shouldn't allow that.
2007-02-28T17:21:00.000Z	rlj	mneptok	what do you mean? as long as it gets tp take away ubuntu-desktop as well, it shouldn't complain about removing ooo etc?
