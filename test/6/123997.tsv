2006-04-22T05:13:00.000Z	Henry_Bean		hi, anybody knows how to mount a digital camera as a storage device?
2006-04-22T05:13:00.000Z	Henry_Bean		to upload things into its memory card
2006-04-22T05:13:00.000Z	Seveas	Henry_Bean	not all cameras can do that. The ones that can, will automount
2006-04-22T05:14:00.000Z	Seveas	Henry_Bean	the others should be used via f-spot or a similar program
2006-04-22T05:14:00.000Z	Henry_Bean	Seveas	mwe: yes, this one make the automount, but opens the default program to import the pictures...
