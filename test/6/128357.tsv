2006-03-30T17:11:00.000Z	hurax		hi, do you know why i have 3 ports open on a default ubuntu install? one is cupsd which i can remove, but the other are hpiod and python (?)
2006-03-30T17:13:00.000Z	maihem	hurax	are these open externally or only locally? What users do they run as?
2006-03-30T17:14:00.000Z	maihem	hurax	`lsof | grep IPv4`
2006-03-30T17:16:00.000Z	maihem	hurax	for me, all the three you mention are local only
2006-03-30T17:16:00.000Z	maihem	hurax	they're also running as nonprivileged users.
2006-03-30T17:18:00.000Z	maihem	hurax	yeah, Windows is the 5uXoR
