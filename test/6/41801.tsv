2011-06-02T03:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	halvor	you might want to check out Handbrake (it's not in the default repository however), there is a PPA
2011-06-02T03:26:00.000Z	halvor	ZykoticK9	tried that...i can't install handbrake
2011-06-02T03:26:00.000Z	halvor	ZykoticK9	at least not from the ppas i've found so far
2011-06-02T03:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	halvor	sorry i don't have any other suggestions.  Good luck.
2011-06-02T03:28:00.000Z	halvor	ZykoticK9	maybe it's a bit shameful but i'll try to use the win version of handbrake under wine :)
