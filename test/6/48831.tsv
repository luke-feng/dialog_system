2011-11-05T21:54:00.000Z	cousteau		how does recovery mode work? I tried it a while ago and it gave me a root terminal, but the disk was mounted as read only so there was nothing I could do
2011-11-05T21:54:00.000Z	||arifaX	cousteau	you have to remount it writeable
2011-11-05T21:55:00.000Z	cousteau	||arifaX	umount and mount?
2011-11-05T21:56:00.000Z	||arifaX	cousteau	I think     mount -n -o remount,rw /               should do the job
2011-11-05T21:56:00.000Z	cousteau	||arifaX	ok (no need to umount first then?)
2011-11-05T21:56:00.000Z	||arifaX	cousteau	no just remount
