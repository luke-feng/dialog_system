2010-01-06T15:35:00.000Z	koichirose	kinja-sheep	yes, it is a sata hard drive in a usb box

2010-01-06T15:37:00.000Z	koichirose	kinja-sheep	no. I was thinking a single partition. It'll happen maybe once a year that it will have to be used on non unix oses

2010-01-06T15:47:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	koichirose	rsync -avz --progress --human-readable :)
