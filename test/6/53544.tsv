2009-09-22T09:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	agliodbs	install openssh-server
2009-09-22T09:46:00.000Z	agliodbs	lstarnes	ah, thanks.  thought it was installed by default
2009-09-22T09:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	agliodbs	I think ubuntu server may have it by default
2009-09-22T09:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	agliodbs	check ps aux | grep sshd
2009-09-22T09:47:00.000Z	agliodbs	lstarnes	no, you're right, it's not installed by default
