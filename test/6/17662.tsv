2010-08-27T01:01:00.000Z	rrndman		why is mouse in ubuntu so imprecise? can I make it behave more windows-like? for example, in windows I can move mouse perfectly horizontally and vertically, while in ubuntu I can't
2010-08-27T01:01:00.000Z	Aimee	rrndman	does it move really fast or erratically all over the screen?
2010-08-27T01:02:00.000Z	Aimee		Yeah
2010-08-27T01:02:00.000Z	Aimee		System -> Preferences and the controls you're looking for is under the General tab
2010-08-27T01:03:00.000Z	rrndman	Aimee	no, it's just that it doesn't feel right, it's hard to explain... it's just very awkward and uncomfortable, I have difficulties aiming the right window controls or selecting text
