2006-12-19T13:54:00.000Z	delta		I've dapper installed and some problem with the graphic card. Should I upgrade to edgy?
2006-12-19T13:55:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	delta	depends. if edgy is right for you, why arent you running it alread? if it isnt, then the awnser is 'no, you shouldnt upgrade under any circumstances'. whats the problem you are having with your card?
2006-12-19T13:56:00.000Z	delta	nolimitsoya	I didn't upgrade yet because I hadn't the time to upgrade, possibly break the system and find time to fix it.

2006-12-19T13:58:00.000Z	delta	nolimitsoya	any idea?
