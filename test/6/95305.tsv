2007-01-27T16:04:00.000Z	Cryoniq	shatrat	true one shouldn't. Seems more like there are trouble to find unrar for him
2007-02-19T17:18:00.000Z	shatrat	Cryoniq	it depends on how you installed your drivers in the first place.  Most repositories should auto update them.  if you run glxinfo | grep rendering does it say yes?
2007-02-19T17:19:00.000Z	shatrat	Cryoniq	the warning is harmless.  You look to be in good shape as far as drivers go.

2007-02-19T17:21:00.000Z	Cryoniq	shatrat	aye.. that is why I unloaded beryl and tried as well :)
