2007-07-28T13:33:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu		Ok Ive got one of my HDs mounted but it's permissions are listed as root. I did sudo chown -hR brandon:brandon /media/disk, but it didnt change the permissions. What do I need to do?
2007-07-28T13:34:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu		no
2007-07-28T13:34:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu		reiser
2007-07-28T13:36:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu		it's mounted read/write
2007-07-28T13:36:00.000Z	PF|Ubuntu		I put it in the fstab earlier
