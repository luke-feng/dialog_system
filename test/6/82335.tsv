2011-04-15T04:19:00.000Z	kdub	abstrakt	yeah, but it really helps to understand the linkers, kernel, all the stuff things run on. forces you out of the newbie sandbox
2011-04-15T04:20:00.000Z	abstrakt	kdub	learning C forces you out of the newbie sandbox, what's your point?
2011-04-15T04:22:00.000Z	kdub	abstrakt	the point is its important to learn C, but its also important to learn the command line, autotools, revision control systems, etc if you're going to do any meaningful contributions
2011-04-15T04:22:00.000Z	abstrakt	kdub	um, that's the point? um... yes, in fact now you are agreeing with my original point, thank you
2011-04-15T04:49:00.000Z	kdub	abstrakt	i'm with you on that java sentiment
