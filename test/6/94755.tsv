2007-04-13T10:59:00.000Z	rambo3	netsrot	compiling ? do you know what compiling is
2007-04-13T11:00:00.000Z	netsrot	rambo3	yes I used to run gentoo before, I have gotten lazy =)
2007-04-13T11:01:00.000Z	rambo3	netsrot	that doesn't say much ,  Gentoo is just as easy as any other distro
2007-04-13T11:03:00.000Z	netsrot	rambo3	ok, but I was running gentoo 64bit before and tried running an 32bit environment inside it and it was a lot of trouble setting it up straight.
2007-04-13T11:04:00.000Z	netsrot	rambo3	a lot of programs I run usually only release the source code so I have to compile them and they only support 32bit.
