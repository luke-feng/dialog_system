2007-07-07T10:23:00.000Z	valehru		My Graphics card is running at 97 degrees celcius.  Any way I can bring that down, its not doing anything intensive that I can tell, I just started up the machine.
2007-07-07T10:24:00.000Z	pike_	valehru	id verify that in the bios. ive often gotten inaccurate numbers in linux
2007-07-07T10:24:00.000Z	valehru	pike_	well my computer regularly shuts down due to reaching 100 degrees....its nuts!
2007-07-07T10:25:00.000Z	pike_	valehru	well thats bad :) i have mine set to shutdown at 70 cel i think
2007-07-07T10:25:00.000Z	valehru	pike_	tell me about it.
