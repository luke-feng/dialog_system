2008-04-08T21:48:00.000Z	GradientMac		Guys, I'm a Mac user, and I'm just wondering how to boot Ubuntu as a live CD without effecting Mac OS X underneath- all I want to do is check out Ubuntu, I might install it on my school laptop if it's good enough to surpass Windows. I do NOT want it on my Mac though, I just want to see it on my Mac.
