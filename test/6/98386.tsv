2007-11-05T03:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	makuseru	are you thinking an old or new laptop?
2007-11-05T03:32:00.000Z	makuseru	IndyGunFreak	new
2007-11-05T03:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	makuseru	have you looked at Dell?.. they are selling laptops w/ ubuntu preinstalled.
2007-11-05T03:33:00.000Z	makuseru	IndyGunFreak	you still pay for "support" and they have limited models
2007-11-05T03:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	makuseru	just a suggestion, i really don't have an answer to your question.
