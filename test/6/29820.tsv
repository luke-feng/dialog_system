2009-10-22T08:33:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	GBGames	is it on ur local network?
2009-10-22T08:34:00.000Z	GBGames	BoxMagnet	Is what on my local network?
2009-10-22T08:34:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	GBGames	are the 2 machines on your local network?
2009-10-22T08:35:00.000Z	GBGames	BoxMagnet	2 machines? I'm trying to use the Ekiga server's echo service.
2009-10-22T08:36:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	GBGames	ok, id forward the ports if you know what they are. sorry for the misread
