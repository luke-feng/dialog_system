2006-07-11T06:21:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	Wipster	I'm not sure on how to delete old kernels, but as I can tell, your fine, if you can boot up and everything runs fine, it may have just put the wrong name perhaps.
2006-07-11T06:21:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	Wipster	doom_oo7 may be correct.
2006-07-11T06:21:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	Wipster	rm -r <kernel> could work.
2006-07-11T06:21:00.000Z	PyroticShadow	Wipster	of course, that also, apt-get remove <kernel>
