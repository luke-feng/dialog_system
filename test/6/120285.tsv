2006-06-19T13:26:00.000Z	Kinetico		how do i reinstall my cd drive?
2006-06-19T13:27:00.000Z	Kinetico		my cd drive mounts the install and live version but nothing else

2006-06-19T13:29:00.000Z	Warbo	Kinetico	I just told you how to "reinstall" your CDROM, but also said that this will probably not help. Reinstalling will reinstall. Actually fixing will solve the problem :)
2006-06-19T13:30:00.000Z	Warbo	Kinetico	Are the CDs written by a CD Writer, or from Canonical?
2006-06-19T13:32:00.000Z	Warbo	Kinetico	I was going to suggest that writable discs aren't showing up, but if you have tried regular discs as well then I don't know (BTW, have you tried mounting it manually? DOes it work or give an error?)
