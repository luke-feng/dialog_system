2012-03-23T23:22:00.000Z	User47		i know all that , i tried it even in Oneirc it dosen't work too
2012-03-23T23:22:00.000Z	oCean	User47	nvm, if you are currently running 12.04, it's offtopic for this channel. Maybe try #vbox
2012-03-23T23:23:00.000Z	User47	oCean	i have 4 pc s , i 'm running 4 different versions of Linux , it dosen't work anywhere
2012-03-23T23:24:00.000Z	oCean	User47	exactly my point, it is not an ubuntu issue. Ask in #vbox
