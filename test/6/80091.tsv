2007-08-31T10:08:00.000Z	maestrojed		I am attempting my first install of ubuntu.  I am using the 6.06 LTS.  I go through the six questions and it starts installing but locks up at 0%.  I am now downloading the alternative CD.  Are there any other suggestions?
2007-08-31T10:09:00.000Z	h1st0	maestrojed	check the cd for errors
2007-08-31T10:09:00.000Z	h1st0	maestrojed	or it could be hanging when its partitioning the drive?
2007-08-31T10:12:00.000Z	maestrojed	h1st0	it could be, I choose to format the entire disk
