2010-03-15T15:57:00.000Z	airtonix	n8w	your swap needs to be at least 1.5 times the size of your real ram
2010-03-15T15:58:00.000Z	n8w	airtonix	 ye i know, i did some research on that n opinions r different from person to person
2010-03-15T15:59:00.000Z	n8w	airtonix	 i think that as long as my swap is at least the same size as my ram i should b ok
