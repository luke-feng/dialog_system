2008-11-03T23:01:00.000Z	sisseck		Hi im having some trouble with my zepto 6214w laptop. As long as i have it plugged in with powersupply ubuntu works great and boots with no problems. When i try to boot on battery, everything freezes. unless i start tapping away at the ESC key then it will slowly boot up. once ubuntu is running on battery everything is really slow and laggy. about 10 sec after i plug in the power ubuntu speeds up. Any ideas+

2008-11-03T23:04:00.000Z	sisseck	raavi	any way i can disable it just to check if thats the problem?
