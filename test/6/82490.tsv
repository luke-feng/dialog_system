2007-07-21T10:39:00.000Z	hexstar	azslande	there's an alternative install cd I believe that is text based
2007-07-21T10:40:00.000Z	azslande	hexstar	would that be on the Ubuntu site itself?
2007-07-21T10:40:00.000Z	hexstar	azslande	should be, check the mirrors
2007-07-21T10:40:00.000Z	azslande	hexstar	Thanks, I will look into it
2007-07-21T11:19:00.000Z	hexstar	azslande	ah lol
