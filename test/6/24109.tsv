2010-06-13T03:10:00.000Z	guntbert	PatrinStar	I don't understand: "mount an iso to an usb flash drive" - can you explain?
2010-06-13T03:12:00.000Z	PatrinStar	guntbert	im using linux ubuntu 9.04 and i want to take a windows 7 iso image and mount it on a 4gb flash drive so i can install windows 7 on my netbook
2010-06-13T03:14:00.000Z	guntbert	PatrinStar	I still don't understand  - mount means to attach a file system to a directory -- if you want to create a usb boot media for windows then this is not the right channel
2010-06-13T03:15:00.000Z	PatrinStar	guntbert	ok, sorry i have my terminalogy wrong. i know that, thats why im asking what channel should i go into cause i dont know where to ask without getting in trouble
