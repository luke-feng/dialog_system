2007-09-11T15:50:00.000Z	amunra		I have only one thing to say about WIndows and I will stop..
2007-09-11T15:50:00.000Z	amunra		It has always annoyed me in WIndows where the simple change of a file extension can change a file from a harmless text file - into one that may be executed by the system etc...
2007-09-11T15:50:00.000Z	amunra		Why they thought that was a good design I will never know
