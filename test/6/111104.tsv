2009-06-13T14:05:00.000Z	Mear1		I want to make edubuntu available for a kindergarten I work for, but since the people who ask there are very computer illiterate, I figured I'd install it on an usb and not on the computer. can i do this?
2009-06-13T14:05:00.000Z	Mear1		And I don't mean as in a live version

2009-06-13T14:07:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Mear1	although you will find it is not as fast so the experience will be very much a mixed bag
2009-06-13T14:07:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Mear1	that is not the live version... read the link I gave you
