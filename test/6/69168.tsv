2008-10-11T01:21:00.000Z	msikma_		Frustrating... my X server still cannot start, even though I know which card I have (ATI Technologies Inc. Rage Mobility M3 AGP 2x (rev 02))...
2008-10-11T01:21:00.000Z	msikma_		I tried a bunch of things but it just won't work.  It says it can't enable the fb, it doesn't find any screens...
2008-10-11T01:22:00.000Z	msikma_		I'm in text mode right now because the installer can't even activate X
2008-10-11T01:23:00.000Z	msikma_		As in, first time, without having tampered with xorg
