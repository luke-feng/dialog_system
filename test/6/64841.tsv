2008-01-29T09:00:00.000Z	Joespeh		I have two hard drives - C: and G: ----  G: has my previous MY Documents on it. I want to keep my documents and dual install xp and ubuntu - do I need to partition the G: drive when I install it? (XP is on C:)

2008-01-29T09:03:00.000Z	Joespeh	magic_ninja	- My G: drive (200 gig) is much bigger than my C: drive (30 gig), I think it would make sense to put windows on C and linux on G:,  do I have to partition my G: drive to keep my documents?
