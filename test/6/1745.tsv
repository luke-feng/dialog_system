2012-06-12T18:24:00.000Z	mun		does anyone else find that ubuntu has too many system updates? after each update, something just has to break. from 11.04 to 11.10, my laptop's volume up/down notification doesn't work properly...
2012-06-12T18:26:00.000Z	mun		well, then i guess i should be saying there're too many major updates.
2012-06-12T18:26:00.000Z	mun		i really don't want to jump ship and move to OSX.
2012-06-12T18:26:00.000Z	mun		but these major updates really piss me off.
