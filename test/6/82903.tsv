2007-07-12T09:01:00.000Z	TheNo1Yeti	TheCreationist	Does Konversation has a list of users in the channel?  Cause I can't find that in XChat
2007-07-12T09:02:00.000Z	TheCreationist	TheNo1Yeti	Yes, it does by default.  And if I remember correctly, XChat's user list is there, but it's hidden by being sized down too much.
2007-07-12T09:02:00.000Z	TheNo1Yeti	TheCreationist	lol thanks.  I feel bad that I just got owned by a sizing bar I been staring at for 10 minutes
2007-07-12T09:02:00.000Z	TheCreationist	TheNo1Yeti	You found it then? ;)
2007-07-12T09:02:00.000Z	TheNo1Yeti		lol yea
2007-07-12T09:03:00.000Z	TheCreationist	TheNo1Yeti	Yeah, took me forever to figure that one out too ;)
