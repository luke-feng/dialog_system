2005-05-24T09:55:00.000Z	muszek		during installation, ubuntu detected my 2 ethernet cards.  after installation there's only modem in administration --> networking.  somebody help please... can't find a solution.
2005-05-24T09:57:00.000Z	muszek		anyone? please... it also smashed my fedora's grub and I'm dead-alike right now (can't reinstall grub for some reason)
2005-05-24T09:57:00.000Z	muszek		but the networking problem is what I care about now...
