2010-11-16T18:40:00.000Z	tarzeau	red2kic	upgrading works great! i love it
2010-11-16T18:41:00.000Z	tarzeau	red2kic	what doesn't work great is gnome software (since they have badly designed configuration files)
2010-11-16T18:42:00.000Z	red2kic	tarzeau	Ah. I don't mind backing up $HOME and /etc (Only 15MB) :)
2010-11-16T18:42:00.000Z	tarzeau	red2kic	wow. wonder what you work... i've got terabytes (across several hosts :)
2010-11-16T18:43:00.000Z	red2kic	tarzeau	20GB SATA HDD (for linux OS), 2TB SATA HDD (for my personal + media files). Easier to keep things separate should something go wrong. Ho ho ho
