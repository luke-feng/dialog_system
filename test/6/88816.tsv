2008-01-19T03:50:00.000Z	LjL	underwatercow	you shouldn't normally touch it manually. its purpose is to give you (and even more importantly, programs) a way to give a generic command (for example try typing "editor" in a shell, or same goes with "java" for instance), without caring which specific program is used. for instance, "editor" is set to "nano" on my system, but it could be some other editor, and "java" is set to the Sun VM, but it could be set to one of the dozen other Java VMs
2008-01-19T03:51:00.000Z	LjL	underwatercow	the way to configure it is to use the "update-alternatives" command. see it's --help option. example: "sudo update-alternatives --config editor".
2008-01-19T03:51:00.000Z	underwatercow	LjL	does it also remember old links somehow so they can be reverted? Why exactly is it better to have in /etc/alternatives than to make the link point directly at the executable?
2008-01-19T03:53:00.000Z	LjL	underwatercow	i don't get you... what do you mean "old links" and "reverted"? and, it's better because that allows a system like the one update-alternatives implement to work. it's managed automatically by apt-get: when you install a new program that has alternatives, it's shown in "update-alternatives", and when you remove it, it goes back to another alternative
2008-01-19T03:54:00.000Z	underwatercow	LjL	Where does it keep track of program alternatives?
