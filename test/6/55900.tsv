2009-08-26T05:00:00.000Z	jachee	bastidrazor	i'd like alll the gnome panelss to go away, for sure
2009-08-26T05:05:00.000Z	jachee	bastidrazor	i'd like to flop back and forth, until I'm sure I like xfce enough to swap permanently. thanks though. :)
2009-08-26T05:06:00.000Z	bastidrazor	jachee	okay, when you switch sessions you're switching from gnome to xfce and still have the panel?
2009-08-26T05:07:00.000Z	jachee	bastidrazor	even on a fresh boot the gnome paels pop up, but yes. :)
2009-08-26T05:08:00.000Z	bastidrazor	jachee	in xfce you should be able to remove the panel from the desktop.. right click and delete panel
