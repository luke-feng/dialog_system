2011-11-03T08:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	katyl	VGA is a port, not a slot - that page is just wrong...
2011-11-03T08:28:00.000Z	zykotick9	katyl	that makes sense ;)
2011-11-03T08:34:00.000Z	zykotick9	katyl	i won't recommend nvidia (non-free driver), BUT i'd recommend against ATI (also non-free)
2011-11-03T08:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	katyl	nvidia over ati was my point ;)
2011-11-03T08:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	katyl	you're getting a bit offtopic with that question ;)
