2009-12-01T13:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	hellomon	ctrl+z usually works - which app are you using?
2009-12-01T13:15:00.000Z	hellomon	Madpilot	just the file explorer cuz when i accidently delete something i cant undo it. i have to go to the trash and restore it
2009-12-01T13:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	hellomon	ah. Yeah, Nautilus doesn't have an undo. would be nice.
