2005-07-27T16:33:00.000Z	occy		I've got an external raid array that has dual power sources.  (two power cables)  I was wondering if I could have it hooked up to my desktop [it's an old 120G raid array]  and power it on and off when I want to transfer files.  I don't want to have to pay the electricity to have it constantly on.
