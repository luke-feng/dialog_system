2010-01-16T14:26:00.000Z	infid	kwtm	i think it's #ubuntu-offtopic
2010-01-16T14:27:00.000Z	kwtm	infid	How long ago did you check?   I like avidemux, but apparently that's not good enough nowadays
2010-01-16T14:27:00.000Z	infid	kwtm	1999 or so heh
2010-01-16T14:28:00.000Z	kwtm	infid	I've used avidemux to cut and splice video.  But no fancy effects like transition/crossfades, etc.
2010-01-16T14:28:00.000Z	kwtm	infid	Also good for splicing audio
