2007-04-05T06:21:00.000Z	slackern	sizzam	not sure but the standard i think is holding down control button while clicking links
2007-04-05T06:21:00.000Z	sizzam	slackern	doesn't seem to work for me, tried shift, alt, ctrl
2007-04-05T06:22:00.000Z	slackern	sizzam	otherwise you could click the popupblocker icon thingy and choose it to not block that site
2007-04-05T06:22:00.000Z	sizzam	slackern	 i think that allows all popups for that URL, i just want to temporarily allow one pop-up
2007-04-05T06:24:00.000Z	slackern	sizzam	sorry no idea then, maybe they just made it that way =/
