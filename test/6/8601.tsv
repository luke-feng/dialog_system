2011-11-09T05:21:00.000Z	Jake7		Quick question: I just checked the hardware compatibility list for my Asus Eee PC 1000 and found 10.04.3 Lucid recommended. Has anyone had or heard of any experiences running something more current on an Asus 1000?

2011-11-09T05:23:00.000Z	Jake7		dr_wilis: Thanks! I wonder why they haven't updated the hardware compatibility list?
2011-11-09T05:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	Jake7	 limited manpower
