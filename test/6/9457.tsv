2011-05-18T14:26:00.000Z	guru1004_		i saw the command for wireless -> iwconfig wlan0 power off
2011-05-18T14:26:00.000Z	guru1004_	r0fs3ck5	-> yeah don't want to disable it in the bios, but that is certainly better than nothing
2011-05-18T14:29:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	guru1004_	try sudo ifconfig wth0 power off.
