2007-02-13T12:40:00.000Z	gozert	amar	download the Ubuntu 6.06.1 Alternate CD
2007-02-13T12:40:00.000Z	gozert	amar	then insert that while its running
2007-02-13T12:40:00.000Z	gozert	amar	it should autodetect the new version and ask you if you want to upgrade
2007-02-13T12:44:00.000Z	gozert	amar	you can't upgrade 5.10 to 6.10
2007-02-13T12:45:00.000Z	gozert	amar	upgrade to 6.06 first
