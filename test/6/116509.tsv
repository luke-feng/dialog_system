2006-07-04T08:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	snoops	 ive seen quite a few gentoo wiki pages that cover  the MD518 and other mice - in aganozing details.:)
2006-07-04T08:18:00.000Z	snoops	Dr_Willis	haha.. I'm wondering if it's possible to map two buttons to the same function.. say middle click and left click both map to 'left click'
2006-07-04T08:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	snoops	 yes it is. i did that a long time ago.. and amazing thing was the windows drivers would NOT let me do that
2006-07-04T08:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	snoops	 i had a hurt finger so i made the thumb button click :P
2006-07-04T08:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	snoops	 i  just followed that gentoo wiki.. lets see if it worked.. :P brb
