2008-10-07T03:40:00.000Z	smacfarl		any takers?
2008-10-07T03:41:00.000Z	jamesish	smacfarl	It'll offer to destroy everything by default. Why not just repin your sources.list and use apt-get upgrade?
2008-10-07T03:42:00.000Z	smacfarl	jamesish	how do I repin sources.list?
2008-10-07T03:43:00.000Z	jamesish	smacfarl	do some research, silly.
2008-10-07T03:44:00.000Z	smacfarl	jamesish	under what repin? I am new to upgrades. I went from 7.10 8.04 after the 8.04 final.
