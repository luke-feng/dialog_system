2007-12-30T22:14:00.000Z	wols	darius12	ask a real question
2007-12-30T22:15:00.000Z	darius12	wols	I don't know what a "real" question would look like
2007-12-30T22:16:00.000Z	wols	darius12	google "smart questions". follow its advice
2007-12-30T22:17:00.000Z	darius12	wols	but I did ask this question and nobody seems willing/capable to answer
2007-12-30T22:18:00.000Z	wols	darius12	rule of thumb: questions which conatain "anybody" on irc, are dumb. don't do them
