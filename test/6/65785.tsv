2008-07-18T14:24:00.000Z	chrislees		Hi, I have a problem with a friend's computer. Even when there are no extra programs running, the System Monitor still shows data going to or from the network
2008-07-18T14:24:00.000Z	chrislees		When I look with netstat, there is no process identified for this stuff. It's TCP and it's going to port 80, but the process name is "-"
2008-07-18T14:26:00.000Z	chrislees		tcp        0      0 192.168.1.102:54463     61.9.129.151:80         TIME_WAIT   -

2008-07-18T14:30:00.000Z	chrislees	mrtimdog	Will do
