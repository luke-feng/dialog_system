2007-05-21T06:20:00.000Z	Waddledee	linxeh	Windows XP, I was.
2007-05-21T06:21:00.000Z	linxeh	Waddledee	oh, well Windows XP can be totally stable. I hate MS bashing for the sake of it. We have linux boxes at work that crash regularly because the hardware isn't fully supported, or the drivers are of poor quality. equally we have windows boxes with the same behaviour
2007-05-21T06:21:00.000Z	Waddledee	linxeh	I'm not MS bashing for the sake of it.  What spurred me to get Ubuntu was rebooting my XP system, going to bed, getting up, and finding the system so wedged (when I hadn't done anything with it) that I couldn't even reboot.
2007-05-21T06:23:00.000Z	linxeh	Waddledee	I've never seen that at home, nor at work with 5000+ 2k and XP boxes (other than when something bad has happened hardware wise). Maybe these boxes don't do as much as yours though
2007-05-21T06:24:00.000Z	Waddledee	linxeh	it's entirely possible some program I was running was at fault.  That doesn't really solve my problem, though.
