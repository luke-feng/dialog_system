2008-11-24T08:04:00.000Z	bonhoffer		so, looking for an honest helper, why does my "how do i get my usb headset working" question suck so much?
2008-11-24T08:05:00.000Z	bonhoffer		running ubuntu 8.10
2008-11-24T08:06:00.000Z	bonhoffer		it might be working -- no sound that i can hear, but i don't know how to direct sound to a device
2008-11-24T08:07:00.000Z	bonhoffer		o.k. thanks, still learning how to get help here . . . hitting the volume switch causes a pop-up on screen . . . so drivers must be doing something . . .
2008-11-24T08:08:00.000Z	bonhoffer		has anyone gotten plantronics dsp 500, on ubuntu 8.10? google has information on older versions that supposedly worked
2008-11-24T08:08:00.000Z	tritium	bonhoffer	you can stop repeating for a while, please
