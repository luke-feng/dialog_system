2009-11-12T01:38:00.000Z	Jetsetlemming		How do I run programs not listed in the Applications drop-down menu? I installed both 7zip and rar through the software center but I can't run either of them.
2009-11-12T01:39:00.000Z	Jetsetlemming		How do I know what to type in the terminal, though?
2009-11-12T01:40:00.000Z	Jetsetlemming		I needed to extract some rars and Archive Manager seems like it can only do some of them, I don't know why, that's why I was installing the other programs
2009-11-12T01:42:00.000Z	Jetsetlemming		Is file roller the same thing as archive manager? That's what shows up in the software center if I search for the former term
2009-11-12T01:43:00.000Z	Jetsetlemming		There there any way to get a simple "right click -> extract here" command like I can use with winrar in windows?
2009-11-12T01:44:00.000Z	fccf	Jetsetlemming	I think 7zip will do that
