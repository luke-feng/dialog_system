2009-11-09T03:23:00.000Z	trijntje	standarshy	have you looked into the ubuntu live-usb?
2009-11-09T03:24:00.000Z	standarshy	trijntje	I have some questions about that.  It says I can not boot from an ntfs drive, will it work if I partition it and set the fat32 partition as active?
2009-11-09T03:25:00.000Z	standarshy	trijntje	Any ideas?
2009-11-09T03:26:00.000Z	trijntje	standarshy	I'm not sure how that works, sorry. But I think live usb is the best way to boot a live environment without a cd/dvd
2009-11-09T03:27:00.000Z	standarshy	trijntje	I am somewhat hesitant because I hear it's not great for the actuall flash drive with the write cycles and all
