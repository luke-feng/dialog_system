2009-11-05T13:56:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	tubo	i don't understand then how works the create bootable disk of ubuntu karmic ?
2009-11-05T13:56:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	tubo	it's installing a ubuntu on a usb disk and they are not talking about mobo that's the thing to be able to go on any computer just like the live cd does
