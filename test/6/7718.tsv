2011-08-12T20:24:00.000Z	mokti		If a video card is listed in the certified hardware catalog, it is completely supported, correct?
2011-08-12T20:25:00.000Z	thunsucker	mokti	if it's in the list then it's been tested and shown to work
2011-08-12T20:26:00.000Z	mokti	thunsucker	okay, thanks. It was listed under another model of computer though, should it still work okay?
2011-08-12T20:26:00.000Z	thunsucker	mokti	probably, you can also boot a live cd and see how that operates first, if it doesn't work, simply reboot and take the cd out
2011-08-12T20:28:00.000Z	mokti	thunsucker	I don't have the machine yet, I'm thinking about buying it. The model that is listed is the a ThinkPad T420s, and I'm going to pick up a T420
