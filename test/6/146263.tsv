2005-08-04T07:09:00.000Z	reka		what's the best way of installing realplayer?  is there a particular version/alternate program (besides mplayer) i should go for?
2005-08-04T07:10:00.000Z	useruser	reka	you can just download from real.com and install according to their instructions
2005-08-04T07:10:00.000Z	useruser	reka	i'd be surprised if someone had put it in a deb - i doubt that'd be legal
2005-08-04T07:11:00.000Z	reka	useruser	no, there's an rpm for rp10 on the site...but the realplayer package in the repo recommends getting rp8 when run
2005-08-04T07:11:00.000Z	useruser	reka	i would just install the latest version.
2005-08-04T07:12:00.000Z	reka	useruser	ok then, cheers
