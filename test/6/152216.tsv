2006-03-20T11:15:00.000Z	akk		I just updated dapper, and it overwrote my static nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf. Why did it do that?
2006-03-20T11:15:00.000Z	akk		The resolvconf man page talks about PPP and stuff like that, but doesn't seem to admit the possibility that one might use a static IP address with static nameservers.
2006-03-20T11:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	akk	if you use resolvconf, /etc/resolv.conf will change afaik
2006-03-20T11:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	akk	you're supposed to set the static nameservers somewhere else
2006-03-20T11:16:00.000Z	akk	HappyFool	So anyone who intends to use static IP should remove resolvconf first thing?
2006-03-20T11:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	akk	i use breezy; i had to install it manually. don't know about dapper
