2005-03-28T15:29:00.000Z	raa1		hi everyone, I'm wondering if I should install ubuntu now or wait until hoary is released.
2005-03-28T15:29:00.000Z	raa1		Is it easy to upgrade without braking anything
2005-03-28T15:30:00.000Z	farruinn	raa1	you could install warty for the time being then upgrade once hoary is released
2005-03-28T15:31:00.000Z	raa1	farruinn	will it be as easy as apt-get upgrade?
2005-03-28T15:31:00.000Z	farruinn	raa1	yup =)
2005-03-28T15:33:00.000Z	raa1	farruinn	Kewl, thanx...here I go w/ warty
