2005-08-28T09:30:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Thunder00	define stable
2005-08-28T09:31:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Thunder00	lol you are being vague
2005-08-28T09:32:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Thunder00	i assume you mean is not likely to break the whole system and bugs are not major
2005-08-28T09:32:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	Thunder00	colony 3 should be "stable"
