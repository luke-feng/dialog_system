2007-05-27T13:26:00.000Z	_nix_	Clarrisa_2008	Press Ctrl-Alt-F1 to switch to an unused cli
2007-05-27T13:27:00.000Z	_nix_	Clarrisa_2008	the following command removes GDM from startup: sudo for i in 2 3 4 5; do mv S99gdm K99gdm; done;
2007-05-27T13:27:00.000Z	_nix_	Clarrisa_2008	you can start gdm by issuing: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
