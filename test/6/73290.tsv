2007-11-30T17:05:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	rabidpoobear	i believe that is the default behaviour
2007-11-30T17:06:00.000Z	rabidpoobear	devilsadvocate	right, but I can't change the permissions once it's mounted
2007-11-30T17:06:00.000Z	rabidpoobear	devilsadvocate	and I need it to be world-readable
2007-11-30T17:07:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	rabidpoobear	i'm not entirely certain, but i think if you add it to the fstab it may mount correctly
2007-11-30T17:08:00.000Z	rabidpoobear	devilsadvocate	okay, thanks, I'll try that :)
