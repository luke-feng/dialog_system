2011-02-12T02:45:00.000Z	penthief	iceroot_	Not off topic it is related to this persons problem!
2011-02-12T02:45:00.000Z	iceroot_	penthief	youtube is using html5 and flash
2011-02-12T02:46:00.000Z	iceroot_	penthief	what type of format youtube is using is of course offtopic in an ubuntu support channel
2011-02-12T02:47:00.000Z	penthief	iceroot_	I am suggesting that YouTube is not playing flash for karanmenon, but playing HTML5.
