2009-07-07T21:44:00.000Z	aresnick		Hi!  I'm trying to upgrade my kernel (right now synaptic says the package is broken), and it looks like the partition is full, a la https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/244764  -- I was wondering how I can resize my root partition?  Booting from a LiveCD didn't seem to let me use gparted to resize the partition. . .

2009-07-07T21:53:00.000Z	aresnick	mezquitale	Can I unmount root while running?
2009-07-07T21:54:00.000Z	mezquitale	aresnick	try it and see what happens, just make sure you save your work, i've used gparted on my machine and I've been able to change partitions
2009-07-07T21:54:00.000Z	aresnick	mezquitale	OK!
2009-07-07T21:57:00.000Z	aresnick	mezquitale	it doesn't seem like it will let me unmount it.  gparted tries, but then root is still mounted.
