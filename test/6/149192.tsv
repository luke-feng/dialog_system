2005-04-30T13:07:00.000Z	osh		Thank's for your time. I'll have to research this another time.
2005-04-30T13:09:00.000Z	osh		OUCH! It didn't like .avi's at all. It sounded like "cat /dev/random | /dev/dsp"  :-(
2005-04-30T13:10:00.000Z	delire	osh	odd. can you play wave files?
2005-04-30T13:14:00.000Z	osh	delire	Hang on. I'll see if I can find one. I think so though. The "system sounds" are wav's I think.
2005-04-30T13:15:00.000Z	delire	osh	yep try that first.
2005-04-30T13:18:00.000Z	osh	delire	nope. dead silent. I'll have to go now anyway but thanks for your help.
