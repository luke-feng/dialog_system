2012-09-22T00:06:00.000Z	shihan	subcool	you'd be better of installing a windows vm, then create the usb from within it cause setting up the usb flash drive is tough from within linux

2012-09-22T00:08:00.000Z	shihan	subcool	actually have a look at unetbootin, it apparently supports creating windows usb's as well...
