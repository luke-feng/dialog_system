2006-09-17T07:47:00.000Z	keegan_		There isn't a plugin folder for /home/.mozilla
2006-09-17T07:48:00.000Z	keegan_		Are they located anywhere else?
2006-09-17T07:49:00.000Z	keegan_		So I'm guessing there isn't another location for Firefox plugins other than ~/.mozilla then...
2006-09-17T07:49:00.000Z	silvaran	keegan_	There should be something like /usr/lib/mozilla .
