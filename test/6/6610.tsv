2011-09-19T21:04:00.000Z	Gentoo64	macer1	it will
2011-09-19T21:05:00.000Z	Gentoo64	macer1	its nothing to do with ms. os's install a bootloader regardless, to boot
2011-09-19T21:07:00.000Z	Gentoo64	macer1	because MS like their own stuff only
2011-09-19T21:09:00.000Z	Gentoo64	macer1	at the end of the day, when you install windows, youll need to redo grub
2011-09-23T01:34:00.000Z	macer1	Gentoo64	use something else
