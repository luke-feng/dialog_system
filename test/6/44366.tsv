2009-01-11T03:03:00.000Z	slipst	Javier	try vlc
2009-01-11T03:04:00.000Z	slipst	Javier	maybe there's something wrong with your dvd
2009-01-11T03:05:00.000Z	slipst	Javier	same version of VLC in both windows and ubuntu?
2009-01-11T03:06:00.000Z	slipst	Javier	you could try mplayer, maybe you need something from medibuntu (google it) but I don't really know, sorry.
