2008-01-22T14:09:00.000Z	jay-oh-en		how come everytime i click the shutdown button at the top right it freezes my X but i can still click things but nothing happens
2008-01-22T14:10:00.000Z	GHz	jay-oh-en	it runs deeper than firefox though, I had irssi open in one terminal, was gonna get info in a nother terminal from cat /proc/cpu, and every terminal was turminated
