2009-07-23T12:18:00.000Z	Cronos		Mike what did you do to make it work i got lost on other chanels
2009-07-23T12:19:00.000Z	Mike94287	Cronos	I used the command metacity in terminal instead of in tty1, I wasn't able to access it before because my windows were covering up my menus.
2009-07-23T12:21:00.000Z	Mike94287	Cronos	yes
2009-07-23T12:23:00.000Z	Mike94287	Cronos	Okay thanks for your help
2009-07-23T12:24:00.000Z	Mike94287	Cronos	I didn't change anything, the screen just went black and it looked like I was in a full screen terminal
2009-07-23T12:26:00.000Z	Mike94287	Cronos	The really strange thing is that this isn't the first time that full screen terminal has showed up, it first showed up when I turned my fan off but nothing happened that time and now when I turn my fan off again this happened.
