2005-10-20T15:45:00.000Z	fc9k		trying to install ndiswrapper, and the instructions tell me to use the command make
2005-10-20T15:45:00.000Z	fc9k		so i type make, and it says bash: make: command not found or something
2005-10-20T15:46:00.000Z	fc9k		is it on the disc, or do i need internet access for it?
2005-10-20T15:46:00.000Z	sn9	fc9k	are you using ndiswrapper instructions for ubuntu?
