2006-03-01T06:57:00.000Z	Arafangion	WorstPhobia	Try asking #openoffice.org
2006-03-01T06:58:00.000Z	Arafangion	WorstPhobia	Yes, _most_ project channels don't really do much, but #openoffice.org has a healthy population.
2006-03-01T07:10:00.000Z	WorstPhobia	Arafangion	they're ignoring me.
2006-03-01T07:10:00.000Z	Arafangion	WorstPhobia	Ask again tomorrow.
2006-03-01T07:11:00.000Z	Arafangion	WorstPhobia	If they keep ignoring you, I would assume that it's not possible :(
