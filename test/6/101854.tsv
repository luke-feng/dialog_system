2008-06-04T13:56:00.000Z	Flannel	DjViper	You mean your TTys?
2008-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	Flannel	DjViper	"full screen terminal" meaning TTYs? or like a maximized gnome-terminal?
2008-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	DjViper	Flannel	whats ttys?
2008-06-04T13:57:00.000Z	Flannel	DjViper	hit ctrl-alt-f1 (and then hit ctrl-alt-f7 to come back), is that what you mean?
