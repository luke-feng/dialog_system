2009-10-04T11:29:00.000Z	Ipsilon		Hey guys, I'm not a Linux user. But I wanted to know some info on the advantages of using linux. Not for the sake of argument.. but for my information to make certain choices
2009-10-04T11:29:00.000Z	Ipsilon		Beyond the fact that it's free of course
2009-10-04T11:29:00.000Z	Ipsilon		k thanx

2009-10-04T11:31:00.000Z	banisterfiend	Ipsilon	maybe if you use linux you'd become a programmer!!!!!!! :P
2009-10-04T11:31:00.000Z	banisterfiend	Ipsilon	if you do become a programmer, choose ruby, python's overrated ;)
