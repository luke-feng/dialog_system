2005-04-19T08:03:00.000Z	declan		Hi.  Does anyone know how hibernate is supposed to work.  Probably it works for some of you.  You press "hibernate" and the computer goes asleep.  Then what.  How are you supposed to revive it.  With the on-off switch? spacebar? return?  some other key combination?  I can't really tell if its working or not, if I don't know how its supposed to be working.  Thanks.
