2009-01-15T16:53:00.000Z	histo	Someoneis	Some bioses behave wierdly though and just choose a drive that makes no sense.
2009-01-15T16:53:00.000Z	histo	Someoneis	it would just boot vista and ignore grub.
2009-01-15T16:54:00.000Z	histo	Someoneis	if you want ubuntu you can have hte ubuntu/xp drive as a the master and just add vista in grub.
