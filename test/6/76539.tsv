2007-12-06T11:45:00.000Z	vasuvi		Ubuntu has been hanging a lot lately; hanging to the point I have to restart the entire computer.  When it's happened, the only applications open (other than normal GNOME stuff) were Firefox and GNOME Terminal.  Is there any way to tell whether the hangs were caused by Firefox or by the Ubuntu base system?

2007-12-06T11:47:00.000Z	thor	vasuvi	it would only be a way to possibly see an error indication for the hangup
2007-12-06T11:47:00.000Z	vasuvi	thor	that's a possibility, at least if stuff really is responding, though at this point I'd doubt it
