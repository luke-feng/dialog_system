2007-03-04T16:12:00.000Z	slippyr4	eshaase	you can sudo su -

2007-03-04T16:14:00.000Z	eshaase	slippyr4	ok, i like the whole concept of only sudo but at times it does get annoying (no permission to cd somewhere)
2007-03-04T16:15:00.000Z	slippyr4	eshaase	i told you *how* to get round it, now you have to choose whether you think it's a good idea or not
2007-03-04T16:16:00.000Z	eshaase	slippyr4	=) ok, thanks
