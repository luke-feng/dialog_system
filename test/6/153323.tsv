2005-03-11T16:39:00.000Z	lavigj		hey guys, is there a good guide or method for telling just one package to pull from hoary?
2005-03-11T16:41:00.000Z	Ubuntian	lavigj	did u look at http://ubuntuguide.org/
2005-03-11T16:41:00.000Z	lavigj	Ubuntian	is there one on there? I do not want to switch everything to hoary
2005-03-11T16:42:00.000Z	Ubuntian		have a look u might find it, the guide isn't big
2005-03-11T16:43:00.000Z	lavigj	Ubuntian	I have used that site a lot. I will look again though
2005-03-11T16:43:00.000Z	lavigj	Ubuntian	all I see there is a system wide upgrade to hoary
