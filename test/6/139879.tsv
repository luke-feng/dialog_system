2010-11-16T02:46:00.000Z	MrDOS	puddles	I'm about to do that
2010-11-16T02:48:00.000Z	MrDOS	puddles	that's right, I'm stupid
2010-11-16T02:51:00.000Z	MrDOS	puddles	Ahead of you there with the logs, although I can't see what actually happened
2010-11-16T02:53:00.000Z	MrDOS	puddles	because today's the 15th, and everything was alright on the 14th, no?
2010-11-16T02:54:00.000Z	MrDOS	puddles	I wish I could agree, but the machine's been turned on/off pretty much daily
