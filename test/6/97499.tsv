2009-02-17T13:17:00.000Z	kurt		isn't there a backport?

2009-02-17T13:17:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	kurt	You'd also need to add entries to the GRUB menu of course
2009-02-17T13:20:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	kurt	usually the first thing to do is gather logs and other information about the problem and creating a bug-report on launchpad.net
