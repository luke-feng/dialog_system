2006-10-19T15:09:00.000Z	anon32		um, why does Ubuntu ship with restricted drivers?
2006-10-19T15:10:00.000Z	anon32		perhaps I should have said - why does Ubuntu ship with non-free drivers?
2006-10-19T15:11:00.000Z	ww2	anon32	because they are still needed by most consumer-level users, I suppose?
2006-10-19T15:11:00.000Z	anon32		if you can ship non-free drivers, why not ship non-free codecs?
2006-10-19T15:11:00.000Z	anon32	ww2	mm..
2006-10-19T15:11:00.000Z	ww2	anon32	they are optional anyway... it's not like Ubuntu developers are trying to impose the use of proprietary stuff.
