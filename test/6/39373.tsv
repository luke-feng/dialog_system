2010-12-15T06:19:00.000Z	wrb123		i installed Ubuntu 10.10 (previously using Windows 7) and am happy enough with it that i would like to keep it and use it as my only OS.  i have some questions though...
2010-12-15T06:20:00.000Z	wrb123		...i also want to get into programming, learning PHP and Java, but i think maybe i should become familiar first with the Linux environment and Eclipse and such. does anyone have some recommendations on tutorials for perhaps compiling packages/programs in ubuntu and then some basics of using Eclipse with Java (not necessarily doing any programming but becoming familiar with the environment) - i have previous procedural/C type experience so
2010-12-15T06:20:00.000Z	wrb123		 PHP is seeming pretty simple as i read tutorials for it
2010-12-15T06:21:00.000Z	wrb123		i dont want to really jump into Java without knowing what im doing as far as setting up a project and such though
