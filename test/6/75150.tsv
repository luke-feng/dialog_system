2007-10-24T15:46:00.000Z	DeMoNSeEd_	marteh__	all your audio players do it and have done it on both feisty and now gutsy?
2007-10-24T15:47:00.000Z	marteh__	DeMoNSeEd_	yep
2007-10-24T15:47:00.000Z	DeMoNSeEd_		hmm, this is a stumper
2007-10-24T15:48:00.000Z	DeMoNSeEd_	marteh__	is it unique to ubuntu or all distros
2007-10-24T15:49:00.000Z	marteh__	DeMoNSeEd_	don't have any other distros to try i'm afraid
