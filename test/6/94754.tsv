2007-02-03T07:54:00.000Z	ademan		this is driving me nuts, i can't for the life of me get my ATI card to work, i tried the binary installer via ati.com, now i'm trying the bleeding edge driver repository, both of them i get "incompatible kernel module detected - HW accelerated OpenGL will not work"   can anyone help me?  (sorry for reposting but i really need help)
2007-02-03T07:55:00.000Z	laserbeak43	ademan	i tried with just about every distro i used and ive accepted that my card willl get no 3d
2007-02-03T07:55:00.000Z	laserbeak43		screw ati for screwing me
2007-02-03T07:56:00.000Z	laserbeak43		my next card will be nvidia
2007-02-03T07:56:00.000Z	ademan	laserbeak43	heh, unfortunately i'm supposed to go to a lan tonight, i'd like to have 3d support, my nvidia box is PERFECT, but alas, it's been dropped and the mobo is cracked, so i'm limited to my old ati box
