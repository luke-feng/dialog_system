2008-06-04T19:44:00.000Z	soundray	adamt	so after all your ranting about broken packages, the problem is a failure on your part to keep track of your disk usage. What a show!
2008-06-04T19:44:00.000Z	adamt	soundray	no, i don't expect the system to keep every kernel it ever installed. that's just stupid.
2008-06-04T19:45:00.000Z	soundray	adamt	it would be stupid to remove old kernels without asking.
2008-06-04T19:46:00.000Z	soundray	adamt	no, it isn't. It's what a well-behaved system has to do.
