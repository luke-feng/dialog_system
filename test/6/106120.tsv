2007-12-23T00:52:00.000Z	andre		i moved my boot stuff to another partition manually but everytime there is some major update menu.lst is reset to (hd0,0) what should be (hd0,2) where does is that information stored?))
2007-12-23T00:53:00.000Z	wols	andre	groot line in menu.lst
2007-12-23T00:55:00.000Z	andre	wols	that is commented out, so my best guess is that hd0,0 is default and that i should set it to groot (hd0,2)
2007-12-23T00:55:00.000Z	wols	andre	read more carefully before you edit
2007-12-23T00:56:00.000Z	wols	andre	the fact that it's commented is right
2007-12-23T00:56:00.000Z	andre	wols	so i should leave it commented than its just something that ubuntu uses?
