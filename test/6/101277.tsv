2008-04-22T13:58:00.000Z	Muhammad_Saad		I need a graphical tool for recovering lost files.  Does anyone know any?
2008-04-22T13:58:00.000Z	Slart	Muhammad_Saad	testdisk is the only one I know.. it's text based but it's still select and press enter instead of point and click
2008-06-10T21:53:00.000Z	Slart	Muhammad_Saad	it's a windows networking thingy.. kind of like dns but for smb network, afaik
2008-06-10T21:55:00.000Z	Slart	Muhammad_Saad	not really.. I think dns can be used instead..
2009-12-17T20:35:00.000Z	Slart	Muhammad_Saad	well.. encryption is the only way that I know of
2009-12-17T20:36:00.000Z	Slart	Muhammad_Saad	you can always remove the recovery mode from the grub menu.. that makes it a little less obvious... they can still boot from a live cd and do nasty stuff though
