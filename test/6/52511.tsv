2009-04-28T23:12:00.000Z	kdub	Saiki	i just did killall -9 pulseaudio, alsa force-reload. probably not the best way though
2009-04-28T23:12:00.000Z	Saiki	kdub	tried that and it didn;t work
2009-04-28T23:13:00.000Z	kdub	Saiki	my real problem turned out to be my headphones were plugged in the wrong soundcard though...
2009-04-28T23:14:00.000Z	Saiki	kdub	mine is fare morecomplicated, as it stopped working with no chages to hardware/software
