2005-09-15T07:55:00.000Z	Jared1		I know, but I dont understand why it doesnt.  I went to nero and selected "burn as bootable disc"..then I selected my .iso
2005-09-15T07:55:00.000Z	Jared1		I burned it 2 different ways shawnz, because both didnt work
2005-09-15T07:56:00.000Z	Jared1		yeah I've done that lythia
2005-09-15T07:57:00.000Z	Jared1		do I want it to burn it as an ISO or a boot CD?
2005-09-15T07:57:00.000Z	cafuego	Jared1	nero -> Tools -> Burn Image; locate iso, burn.
