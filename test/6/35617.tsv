2009-09-01T14:17:00.000Z	negev		im confused, im running a 'hardy' box, it has php 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.6, yet the only version available on ddebs is 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.7  why is that?
2009-09-01T14:17:00.000Z	negev		is hardy out of date now?
2009-09-01T14:19:00.000Z	negev		anyone know where i can find libapache2-mod-php5-dbgsym_5.2.4-2ubuntu5.6_i386.ddeb?  (as opposed to 5.7)

2009-09-01T14:20:00.000Z	negev	ActionParsnip	yes im aware of that, only one result on google, which is the official ddebs page that doesn't have it
