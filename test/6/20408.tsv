2010-05-26T19:19:00.000Z	contents_	anonymouse	It's not automounting on this installation. I can mount in manually, but I'd like to automount
2010-05-26T19:20:00.000Z	contents_	anonymouse	it automounts on my other lucid installation, and it automounts on a karmic installation on the same computer
2010-05-26T19:20:00.000Z	contents_	anonymouse	it's not there
2010-05-26T19:22:00.000Z	contents_	anonymouse	wait--it is in Places>Computer!
2010-05-26T19:23:00.000Z	contents_	anonymouse	do you know why it's not mounting to the desktop? It's just a bug, you say?
2010-05-26T19:26:00.000Z	contents_	anonymouse	thanks a lot for your help! Somehow I missed that message on the forum. Cheers!
