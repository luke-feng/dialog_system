2010-02-05T00:59:00.000Z	Danbo19		Hello, I am trying to sync my ipod nano using itunes in virtualbox. I have sucsessfully set up windows in virtualbox, my question is: where do I put my music so I can access it in the virtual machine?
2010-02-05T01:00:00.000Z	Danbo19		really? I was unaware itunes works in wine now
2010-02-05T01:01:00.000Z	Danbo19		that sound easier than virtualbox
2010-02-05T01:01:00.000Z	Danbo19		oh, okay well thanks

2010-02-05T01:03:00.000Z	mezquitale	Danbo19	is your device being detected in the virtual machine?
