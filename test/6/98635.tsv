2006-12-21T14:06:00.000Z	boness		I have booted from Ubuntu Live CD and clicked to install it. I just installed Ubuntu without asking me what kind of installation I would like to do (workstation, server) and did not ask which packages I would like to install. Is is write? I remember having some options....
