2011-02-03T04:10:00.000Z	Nanoha		can you tell me how I can write grub to the MBR of my hard drive using GRML?  IS this why my computer just sits at "Loading Operating System..." for hours?

2011-02-03T04:16:00.000Z	Nanoha		I build a brand new system.  one with sata support on the motherboard.  I took out my current hard drive out of the old computer and put it in th enew computer.  But... whatever I try in bios or whatever, I get stuck on "Loading Operating System..."  It will sit there for hours,so I am wondering if my MBR is messed up somehow
