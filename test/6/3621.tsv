2012-02-28T10:00:00.000Z	jsoft		Anyone here have any ideas how I can kind of alter the way devices are auto-mounted? (ie, flash drives)
2012-02-28T10:01:00.000Z	jsoft		Ie, I want to check the device's serial number, and depending on what it is, mount it read only, or to certain mountpoints, or run a program

2012-02-28T10:03:00.000Z	jsoft	L3top	Ok sure, that might be helpfull :)

2012-02-28T10:08:00.000Z	jsoft	L3top	so is it basically a case of telling gnome/whatever to bugger off, and doing the mounting yourself?
