2008-01-17T03:10:00.000Z	EyePulp		I certainly fail in that dept.

2008-01-17T03:11:00.000Z	soundray	EyePulp	I missed your question, please repeat
2008-01-17T03:14:00.000Z	soundray	EyePulp	I would expect out-of-memory conditions to be logged in /var/log/syslog
2008-01-17T03:14:00.000Z	EyePulp	soundray	nice
