2009-03-09T05:05:00.000Z	ubersoldat	corey	how about pressing "Fn+F5" or something like that?
2009-03-09T05:06:00.000Z	corey	ubersoldat	No luck. There is a blue icon on the F5 that looks like it should work
2009-03-09T05:06:00.000Z	ubersoldat	corey	try rebooting with the monitor connected
2009-03-09T05:07:00.000Z	corey	ubersoldat	ctrl alt backspace?
