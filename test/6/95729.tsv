2009-10-31T01:41:00.000Z	Roey		When I tried to install Kubuntu, it didn't recognize my /dev/md* drives...  If I'm installing to a softraid1 partition, do I need the alternate disc?

2009-10-31T01:44:00.000Z	Roey	mage__	ok.
2009-10-31T01:52:00.000Z	mage__	Roey	i know knoppix has that option the ubuntu cd might not have it
2009-10-31T01:52:00.000Z	Roey	mage__	what's the option calld in knoppix again?
