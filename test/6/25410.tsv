2010-08-04T19:34:00.000Z	StuckMojo		is the installer on lucid significantly different from the one on karmic?
2010-08-04T19:34:00.000Z	StuckMojo		it doesn't start in a text-ish mode for me, tries to go straight to X
2010-08-04T19:35:00.000Z	StuckMojo		doesn't seem to like my video though
2010-08-04T19:35:00.000Z	StuckMojo		karmic live cd booted fine

2010-08-04T19:38:00.000Z	StuckMojo	tucemiux	me too, but like i said, the installer cd for lynx ends up in a black screen
