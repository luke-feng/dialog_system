2006-08-28T08:41:00.000Z	DarkAudit	kromel	yep... just finished a session :)
2006-08-28T08:42:00.000Z	kromel		I think I gained about 7 to 10 Frames per second playing City of Heroes in Ubuntu then I did with XP.
2006-08-28T08:43:00.000Z	DarkAudit	kromel	I've noticed that CoX via Cedega doesn't handle some lag spikes as well as in XP, but otherwise runs just fine
2006-08-28T08:46:00.000Z	kromel	DarkAudit	have you tried Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter yet with cedega or WINE?
2006-08-28T08:46:00.000Z	DarkAudit	kromel	not yet... the only game I've got running with Cedega is CoX... lots of alts need attention :)
