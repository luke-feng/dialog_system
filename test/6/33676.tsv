2009-08-06T00:30:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	donnybrasco	hm sudo is superuser i dont think so
2009-08-06T00:30:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	donnybrasco	lemme check permissions possible
2009-08-06T00:34:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	donnybrasco	you should replace it by "mkdir ~/.asoundrc
2009-08-06T00:36:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	donnybrasco	you surely have this folder /home/yourusername(donnybrascomaybe)/
2009-08-06T00:37:00.000Z	donnybrasco	jacquesdupontd	yes I do
