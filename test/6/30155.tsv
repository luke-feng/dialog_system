2009-10-28T14:58:00.000Z	StaRetji		Hello there \o/ Is it SAFE to use this command thousands of time : mount -o remount,rw /dev/sda1   ???

2009-10-28T15:03:00.000Z	StaRetji	joaopinto	I have FAT filesystem which is used to bring up linux .img with ext3 filesystem. FAT file system stores Mediacenter plugins and files inside specific folders became read-only. other folders are OK. if I issues mount -o remount,rw /dev/sda1  everything works well. Is this approach OK? I did dosfsck -a -v /dev/sda1 also
