2009-03-21T05:13:00.000Z	Jork		yeah, I'm wondering if anyone can see what I'm saying? lol

2009-03-21T05:16:00.000Z	clsmith	Jork	Well, are you talking about from /within/ Windows?
2009-03-21T05:16:00.000Z	clsmith	Jork	Okay. What have you done so far? (Anything?)
2009-03-21T05:17:00.000Z	clsmith	Jork	Have you checked the wireless device?
