2005-12-08T10:36:00.000Z	AesopFable		Anyone know where the WINE DLL package is? Is it on the APT somewhere?
2005-12-08T10:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	AesopFable	It's a part of wine
2005-12-08T10:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	AesopFable	They're dll.so files though, iirc.
2005-12-08T10:36:00.000Z	AesopFable	Amaranth	That's what I though, but the error oNe^somewhere pretty much confirms that he's missing them...
2005-12-08T10:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	AesopFable	Missing one that WINE doesn't have, maybe.
2005-12-08T10:38:00.000Z	AesopFable	Amaranth	His compile was failing during the make, so find won't... erm, find it.
