2012-05-18T18:17:00.000Z	jrib	klaus_	don't know then
2012-05-18T18:19:00.000Z	klaus_	jrib	I'm just installing nfs on my server. Maybe it works. Meanwhile: What are the advantages of nfs to sshfs? And what about the authentification?
2012-05-18T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	klaus_	don't know much about that.  One major difference is that ssh is encrypted
2012-05-18T18:22:00.000Z	klaus_	jrib	well but thats an advantage for sshfs i think, though i don't need it cause it's only my private network.
2012-05-18T18:22:00.000Z	jrib	klaus_	yes
