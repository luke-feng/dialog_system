2008-03-03T16:32:00.000Z	karuna_bdc	DSpair	recovery mode? from grub?
2008-03-03T16:32:00.000Z	DSpair	karuna_bdc	Yeah, when you boot there is an option on the kernel command line which looks like "vga=XXX" and that sets your framebuffer vga mode. You'll need to find a mode that works for your PC.
2008-03-03T16:34:00.000Z	DSpair	karuna_bdc	Something else you can try. Try to do a blind login on that cursor screen and see if the cursor moves.
