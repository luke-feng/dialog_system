That means you get a PXE-compliant NIC and boot it, which uses DHCP headers next-server and filename to find a bootloader via TFTP, then that loads a kernel and ramdisk over TFTP, and that then loads a read-only NFS export and merges it with a copy-on-write partition using unionfs, then pivot_roots and boots as normal.

2007-08-07T08:51:00.000Z	DWSR	twb	You trying to install, or just PXE boot?
