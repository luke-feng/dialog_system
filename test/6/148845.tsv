2006-11-26T14:17:00.000Z	kyawzin		Can anybody help me with MAC address hardcoding?
2006-11-26T14:18:00.000Z	kyawzin		I can change the MAC address by running " ifconfig eth0 hw ether 01:02:03:04:05:06" like that
2006-11-26T14:18:00.000Z	kyawzin		but
2006-11-26T14:18:00.000Z	kyawzin		I got to run that command everytime after I boot the system
2006-11-26T14:19:00.000Z	kyawzin		I want to hardcoded the change in MAC address so that I don't need to run the command every time
