2010-05-06T02:53:00.000Z	radhika		Hi, I still haven't been able to figure out how to disable my internal dvd drive, any suggestions?
2010-05-06T02:54:00.000Z	mickster04	radhika	unmount it?
2010-05-06T02:54:00.000Z	mickster04	radhika	disconnect it
2010-05-06T02:55:00.000Z	radhika	mickster04	I tried, it says unmount: command not found and Its an internal one, I can't disconnect it unless I open up the laptop
2010-05-06T03:02:00.000Z	mickster04	radhika	all windows does is uninstall it.i reinstalls it when you reboot
