2007-06-30T09:39:00.000Z	Icehawk78		I had rtorrent running in an ssh window, which was then shut down. After starting a new session, I'm unable to access the running copy of rtorrent (I assume it's still running, because it won't load the .torrent file now), but I also can't find it listed when I ran "ps -el". Any suggestions?

2007-06-30T09:42:00.000Z	levander	Icehawk78	you'll have to read about rtorrent, or look around in your home directory (especially the dot files) to find where it writes it
2007-06-30T09:43:00.000Z	Icehawk78	levander	Thanks, I'll see if I can find it. I'm basically looking for a lock file of sorts?
2007-06-30T09:43:00.000Z	levander	Icehawk78	yeah, lock file is the general idea
2007-06-30T09:44:00.000Z	levander	Icehawk78	that's a generic answer though, I don't know specifically about rtorrent, that's what i'd do though, look for a lock file...
