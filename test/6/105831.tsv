2006-09-28T12:01:00.000Z	brkamikaze	narma	don't ask for "the best" since nobody agrees on "the best" :P
2006-09-28T12:02:00.000Z	narma	brkamikaze	and luke-jr_work , ok thanks I'll take a look to dd
2006-09-28T12:02:00.000Z	brkamikaze	narma	it is not recommended to try it before k3b
2006-09-28T12:03:00.000Z	narma	brkamikaze	ok... very funny ;) so I know gnomebaker but is there another one ? (K3B is for KDE isn't it ?)
2006-09-28T12:04:00.000Z	brkamikaze	narma	K3B is for kde; you can try gcombust I think
