2007-08-11T13:06:00.000Z	Flannel	danny__	Their website says it'll be final when gutsy is released (in october), How much RAM do you have?
2007-08-11T13:07:00.000Z	danny__	Flannel	I have plenty of RAM (2GB), I'm just curious because I like to run Linux distros under VMWare.
2007-08-11T13:08:00.000Z	Flannel	danny__	You'd be able to run gnome in VMWare fine.  But if you're worried about a lightweight system, check out xubuntu.
2007-08-11T13:08:00.000Z	danny__	Flannel	Yes, I use Xubuntu also.
