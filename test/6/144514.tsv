2005-07-15T08:52:00.000Z	jun		hi, i am thinking using ubuntu for my mom.  i have been a long time RH user.  How long does an ubuntu release before it looses support?
2005-07-15T08:53:00.000Z	HappyFool	jun	18 months for the october release. the march 2006 release will have three years support
2005-07-15T08:53:00.000Z	HappyFool	jun	see here: www.ubuntulinux.org/UbuntuFoundation
2005-07-15T08:54:00.000Z	jun		thanks guys, I will look at that webpage.
2005-07-15T08:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	jun	support means release of security patches, i believe -- i presume that is what you mean
2005-07-15T08:54:00.000Z	jun	HappyFool	yes. security patches.  I will be out of the country.  So I will be patching remotely.
