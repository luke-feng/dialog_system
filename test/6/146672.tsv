2005-06-25T10:14:00.000Z	jbroome	apollo2011	testparm
2005-06-25T10:14:00.000Z	apollo2011	jbroome	ok so just "testparm /etc/samba/smb.conf"?
2005-06-25T10:14:00.000Z	jbroome	apollo2011	i believe so
2005-06-25T10:14:00.000Z	apollo2011		cool thx
2005-06-25T10:16:00.000Z	apollo2011	jbroome	it worked and said the file was fine but my Windows pc sees it ok and my other two ubuntu systems say there is an invalid parameter and won't load the shares...
