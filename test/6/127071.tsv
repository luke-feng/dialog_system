2006-01-18T10:00:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie		Quick question about Synaptic - if I install a package that demands a long list of supporting libraries, and then later un-install the package, do the support files get uninstalled automagically?
2006-01-18T10:01:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	UbuntuNewbie	Not that I've noticed.
2006-01-18T10:02:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	PuMpErNiCkLe	- thanks ... do you happen to know if Synaptic's history is searchable?
2006-01-18T10:04:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	UbuntuNewbie	Yes.  File -> History.
2006-01-18T10:04:00.000Z	UbuntuNewbie	PuMpErNiCkLe	- thanks. (Um, and sorry, that was a dumb question. I ought to have looked more carefully.)
2006-01-18T10:06:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	UbuntuNewbie	np :)
