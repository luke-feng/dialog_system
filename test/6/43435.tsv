2009-01-29T00:29:00.000Z	mdm		im having a problem. when i try to download from repositories, I get a warning "You are about to install software that cant be authenticated!". I was trying to download gelemental. Same message also displayed if I try to install from Synaptic package manager or apt-get install. Fairly new to Ubuntu. Is it a problem with my install or the repositories? I am currently running 8.10 on ASUS eee.

2009-01-29T00:31:00.000Z	mdm	Flannel	it only started doing it after I downloaded some updates. Not sure what you mean by keyring?
