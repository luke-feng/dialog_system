2009-06-07T00:07:00.000Z	Joeseph		Out of curiosity, why are my hard drives labled as "sd*#" instead of "hd*#" if they are using IDE?
2009-06-07T00:08:00.000Z	jpds	Joeseph	Cos that was changed.
2009-06-07T00:09:00.000Z	Joeseph	jpds	Do they all say "sd" instead of "hd" now?
2009-06-07T00:09:00.000Z	jpds	Joeseph	Yes.
2009-06-07T00:09:00.000Z	Joeseph	jpds	When did this happen?
2009-06-07T00:10:00.000Z	jpds	Joeseph	I can't remember...
