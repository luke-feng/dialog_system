2006-04-19T09:49:00.000Z	rebel2		Does anyone have some good Ubuntu related docs to help with installing ubuntu as a network office server? I want to set it up so all the machines in the office want to connect through the machine to even get past the router. Also I plan on running samba to do weekly backups of all of the local IP machines

2006-04-19T09:51:00.000Z	rebel2		Ah, where would I look at docs for that wastrel?
