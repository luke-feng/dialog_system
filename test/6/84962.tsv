2007-09-19T11:25:00.000Z	dn4	Pirate_Hunter	yeah, 279.99 for a quad core chip seems insanely cheap
2007-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dn4	I wouldnt say insanely, but cheap yes but than im behind on times, I dont know how long quads have been on the market thats probably why :(
2007-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	dn4	Pirate_Hunter	I think they hit the market this month
2007-09-19T11:29:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dn4	Not bad intel is gaining some brains they've selling products at reasonable prices but than if they dont AMD will hahahaha - yet i was expecting quads to reach the 4.0GHz speed not 2 - 3GHz with over cloacking
2007-09-19T11:30:00.000Z	dn4	Pirate_Hunter	ahh, yeah it is weird how all of a sudden cpus starting going up in hz really fast, then it seems to of capped off around 2-3Ghz, its weird.
2007-09-19T11:32:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dn4	but than they might have been aiming at lower speeds and higher threading considering how many tasks quad can handle
