2012-01-27T07:42:00.000Z	auk		How can I safely have my system ignore file writes to my Solid State Drive?     Would Dev/Null really do?   I want to direct anything for .xsession-errors      to /dev/null (if it's safe to)               Because this file keeps getting as fat as 112GBs of space real quick!
