2011-09-01T16:07:00.000Z	jrib	bullgard6	try "file" and "gvfs-info"
2011-09-01T16:13:00.000Z	bullgard6	jrib	Thank you for your help.
2011-09-01T18:10:00.000Z	jrib	bullgard6	probably find ;)
2011-09-01T18:13:00.000Z	bullgard6	jrib	In this generality your answer is wrong. As 'man find'explains, find - search for files in a directory hierarchy."
2011-09-01T18:13:00.000Z	jrib	bullgard6	yes, find with some options
