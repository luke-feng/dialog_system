2008-09-01T12:22:00.000Z	Guest1		i just installed ubuntu, but it only recognizes 3gb or ram out of the 4 i actually have. vista recognizes all 4
2008-09-01T12:22:00.000Z	Guest1		yes, ubuntu is 32
2008-09-01T12:23:00.000Z	Guest1		i thought it might be that, but rethinking i know that xp reads 4gb of ram i think
2008-09-01T12:23:00.000Z	Guest1		is there a way to fix it? they told me not to install the 64bit version for various reasons...
2008-09-01T12:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Guest1	which reasons?
