2012-01-04T06:28:00.000Z	alkafoo	grape_	probably, /msg alis list *puppy*
2012-01-04T08:25:00.000Z	alkafoo	grape_	if you can't debug issues on your own, you really shouldn't be using puppy
2012-01-04T08:26:00.000Z	alkafoo	grape_	yet clearly it isn't
2012-01-04T08:27:00.000Z	alkafoo	grape_	in the time it's taking you to get this working, you could undoubtedly earn enough to get a modern machine
2012-01-04T08:32:00.000Z	alkafoo	grape_	you don't need free, you can get a modern computer for $100
