2008-01-04T08:32:00.000Z	FantasticFoo	PirateHead	how would i do that?
2008-01-04T08:33:00.000Z	PirateHead	FantasticFoo	If it doesn't require root, you can do it using System -> Preferences -> Sessions
2008-01-04T08:33:00.000Z	PirateHead	FantasticFoo	If it does require root, you'll have to add a system-v style startup script.
2008-01-04T08:34:00.000Z	FantasticFoo	PirateHead	oh. i guess i'll have to do that then
