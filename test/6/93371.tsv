2007-05-02T12:03:00.000Z	dougsko	wakeup_	the program crashed and the core dump is a file that shows what was in memory when it crashed
2007-05-02T12:03:00.000Z	wakeup_	dougsko	where can i find it?
2007-05-02T12:04:00.000Z	dougsko	wakeup_	its probably in the same directory you called the program from
