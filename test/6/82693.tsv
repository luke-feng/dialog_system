2008-01-04T19:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Borbus	ffmpeg is a command line tool, you configure it with command line arguments
2008-01-04T19:44:00.000Z	Borbus	ikonia	so when stuff like mplayer uses ffmpeg it is actually passing cli to ffmpeg and getting the decoded output?
2008-01-04T19:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Borbus	no, then it's using the libraries,
2008-01-04T19:45:00.000Z	Borbus		Oh..
2008-01-04T19:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Borbus	but in essence yes
