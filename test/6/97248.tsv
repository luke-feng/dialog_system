2007-01-06T13:39:00.000Z	kuzmaster		how stable is ubuntu 6.10 edgy etf with networking and such?
2007-01-06T13:39:00.000Z	dstaudt	kuzmaster	very, in my experience - though i understand some wireless functionality works better in dapper
2007-01-06T13:40:00.000Z	kuzmaster	dstaudt	well, when i used dapper, the wireless worked fine in kubuntu......
2007-01-06T13:40:00.000Z	kuzmaster	dstaudt	but, im just wondering how good it would be with ubuntu 6.10.....
2007-01-06T13:41:00.000Z	dstaudt	kuzmaster	try the live cd, maybe :)
