2010-04-15T11:48:00.000Z	futuresoon		i do "ssh myserver.com" and it asks me for a passphrase even though it's empty
2010-04-15T11:49:00.000Z	Serraphyn	futuresoon	you can setup a file that holds username and passwords for ssh but its not really a good idea
2010-04-15T11:49:00.000Z	futuresoon	Serraphyn	i feel like this isn't typical behavior but is it?
2010-04-15T11:49:00.000Z	futuresoon		i think from other computers it doesn't ask me cause it knows there isn't one? or something?
