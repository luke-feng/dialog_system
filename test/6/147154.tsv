2006-03-20T09:19:00.000Z	jeffer		i'm new to linux and installing stuff is hard for me
2006-03-20T09:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	jeffer	then the easiest way to get the new Firefox would be to wait until the new version of Ubuntu comes out in a while
2006-03-20T09:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	jeffer	looks like it'll be out in June
