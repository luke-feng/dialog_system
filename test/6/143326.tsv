2009-03-01T21:28:00.000Z	user_	Sonderblade	its only mysql client packages
2009-03-01T21:28:00.000Z	Sonderblade	user_	it still makes no sense
2009-03-01T21:29:00.000Z	user_	Sonderblade	i dont know of the details, but say subversion has a mysql bridge ande the packagers decided its worth including for ubuntu..
2009-03-01T21:32:00.000Z	Sonderblade	user_	it has no mysql bridge. subversion is a version control system and mysql is a database, there is no relation between them
2009-03-01T21:33:00.000Z	user_	Sonderblade	launchpad, maybe they already have a report discussing it..
