2006-06-10T09:39:00.000Z	nootrope		i have two questions, please: which IRC client do you recommend (i'm using xchat)? and, how can i find out the default location where applications save files. Fro example, Sound Recorder doesn't prompt for anything and just saves files...somewhere.

2006-06-10T09:39:00.000Z	siccness	nootrope	Keep in mind that irssi is cli.
