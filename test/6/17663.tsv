2010-08-29T06:18:00.000Z	Jammet		It looks like the video has a small delay, but only for a portion of the screen, which happens to be the shape of a triangle. It's a really strange looking effect but happens many times.

2010-08-29T06:19:00.000Z	Jammet	Aimee	Yes?
2010-08-29T06:20:00.000Z	Jammet	Aimee	I can still see it, but it appears to be ... ... it's like a really strong vsync problem that's triangle shaped. Hard to explain with words. You can see the part of the video but it lags.
