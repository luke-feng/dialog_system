2010-05-04T18:09:00.000Z	omac	fdrake	 Then it should say that instead:  "unmount this filesystem only"  and "unmount all filesystems on this drive".
2010-05-04T18:10:00.000Z	fdrake	omac	Perhaps, though that doesn't address the device-disconnection aspect of safely-remove.
2010-05-04T18:11:00.000Z	omac	fdrake	 yeah, I'm a terminal user too, I just use mount, sync, sync and umount too.

2010-05-04T18:22:00.000Z	fdrake	omac	Thanks!  I'll try that.
