2011-05-17T03:33:00.000Z	zvacet	sroy2	try from terminal sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2011-05-17T03:33:00.000Z	sroy2	zvacet	I'll try that instead of using synaptic...
2011-05-17T03:36:00.000Z	zvacet	sroy2	did you tried to run commands from terminal and did you get any errors
2011-05-17T03:37:00.000Z	zvacet	sroy2	you can try with sudo apt-get dist-upgrade in case that some packages are hold
2011-05-17T03:44:00.000Z	zvacet	sroy2	as KM0201 give us pastebin of sudo apt-get upgrade
