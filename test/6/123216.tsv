2009-10-23T23:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	jrwcox	I didn't know they now have an "install from file" option.. I have a MFC7440N networked at home and it work fine for printing.. but that's just about it.. scanning works only when using xsane as root.. not recommended.
2009-10-23T23:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	jrwcox	perhaps you're referring to the ubuntu auto installer.. not the brother installer.
2009-10-23T23:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	jrwcox	the brother drivers are not easy to install.. you have to bounce around on their site for all the ubuntu instructions..
2009-10-23T23:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	jrwcox	do just the printing portion first.. then the rest
2009-10-23T23:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	jrwcox	no not really
