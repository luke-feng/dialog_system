2012-01-09T01:59:00.000Z	bullgard6	wildwind	So this program assumes that the pause time for meta data transmission is 16 s? That much?
2012-01-09T02:00:00.000Z	wildwind	bullgard6	yes. not so much IMO
2012-01-09T02:01:00.000Z	bullgard6	wildwind	 Right. Thank you.
2012-01-09T02:01:00.000Z	wildwind	bullgard6	not program assumes, but server announces i think
