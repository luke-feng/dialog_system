2007-05-20T15:31:00.000Z	blackjackel	kitche	thats what Im trying to find out, but my restricted drivers manager says im using restricted drivers
2007-05-20T15:32:00.000Z	kitche	blackjackel	oh you might be using the ati drivers but not fully
2007-05-20T15:32:00.000Z	blackjackel	kitche	how can I use them fully? I'm having serious framerate issues with games...
2007-05-20T15:32:00.000Z	kitche		!ati | blackjackel follow this since I don't like ATI drivers soI can't fix problems with them when people have them
2007-05-20T15:33:00.000Z	blackjackel	kitche	thanks, will do
