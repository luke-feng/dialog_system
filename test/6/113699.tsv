2012-10-18T20:06:00.000Z	_Trullo		what is best, tracker or beagle?
2012-10-18T20:06:00.000Z	_Trullo		what a useless tip somsip.
2012-10-18T20:08:00.000Z	_Trullo		he could have told me, tracker is good for searching for files, beagle is good when you want to search for content in files
2012-10-18T20:08:00.000Z	_Trullo		I'm going with tracker
2012-10-18T20:09:00.000Z	_Trullo		well, it's bad when you get help on google faster than in a channel with humans :/
2012-10-18T20:09:00.000Z	jrib	_Trullo	hmm, pretty sure tracker searches inside files too
