2006-05-25T13:26:00.000Z	Tidus	scabootssca	is the windows FS formatted as NTFS ?
2006-05-25T13:27:00.000Z	Tidus	scabootssca	linux can't write to NTFS
2006-05-25T13:28:00.000Z	Tidus	scabootssca	you can try using a program called captive-ntfs, which uses the windows native ntfs drivers to allow full safe write.
2006-05-25T13:28:00.000Z	Tidus	scabootssca	but dont come calling when it breaks your system
