2011-02-25T14:57:00.000Z	shomon		hi, I've tried to set up my site with dyndns and it has been working, but every time I reboot, ufw seems to reset itself... anyone know why?
2011-02-25T14:57:00.000Z	shomon		also I just told it to open port 80 and I can't reach it even just via the IP from outside.
2011-02-25T14:58:00.000Z	shomon		how can I check what is actually open on my box? maybe another firewall program is interfering...
