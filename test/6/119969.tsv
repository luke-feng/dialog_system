2009-05-04T20:57:00.000Z	argot76		So they pay for driver support and stuff?
2009-05-04T20:57:00.000Z	argot76		That is good.
2009-05-04T20:57:00.000Z	argot76		My bad.
2009-05-04T20:57:00.000Z	argot76		I was just wondering.
2009-05-04T20:58:00.000Z	Ademan	argot76	I would say because of the extra polish that has gone into ubuntu on top of the solid base of debian, and more importantly, this channel and the ubuntu forums are FULL of helpful and supportive people who welcome, guide and help new users
