2012-03-06T06:59:00.000Z	Praxi		hmm wish my luck, trying to replace my windows work station with linux, see if I can keep it up
2012-03-06T06:59:00.000Z	Praxi		wish me*
2012-03-06T07:00:00.000Z	Praxi		really worried about some of the things I do, lot of MSSQL & Visio, think I can handle the rest of the junk but those 2 things worry me a bit.
2012-03-06T07:01:00.000Z	Praxi		ya what I'm trying now
2012-03-06T07:01:00.000Z	Praxi		installing wine that is.  and I'm not sure how libre office spreadsheet will play with ODBC type things
2012-03-06T07:03:00.000Z	KI7MT	Praxi	LibreOffice supports ODBC, and I think there's a draw program, but not sure how vast it is compared to Visio
