2011-10-18T18:12:00.000Z	martian		I have a samba share mounted with cifs via my fstab, and for some reason all files are showing up with the execute bit set. Why?
2011-10-18T18:13:00.000Z	compdoc	martian	you dont normally mount samba shares in fstab. at least Ive never seen anyone do that
2011-10-18T18:15:00.000Z	martian	compdoc	hmm... I do. I've done this on several systems for a while now. Just set the _netdev option and all is usually happy. Ever since I reinstalled 11.04 and used the same old fstab entry, everything is +x
2011-10-18T18:17:00.000Z	compdoc	martian	for me, fstab is for mounting partitions, and /ect/smb.conf is for mounting samba shares. smb.conf has many more options
