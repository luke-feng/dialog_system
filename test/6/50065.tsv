2008-09-30T15:36:00.000Z	meepo		has anyone here built linux from scratch using ubuntu?
2008-09-30T15:36:00.000Z	meepo		I can't get the liveCD so I'm hoping it's not buggy if done from ubuntu
2008-09-30T15:37:00.000Z	meepo		I mean from linuxfromscratch.org
2008-09-30T15:37:00.000Z	DJones	meepo	How do you mean you can't get the livecd? You can't download, or it won't install
2008-09-30T15:38:00.000Z	DJones	meepo	Sorry, I think I've misread what you meant
2008-09-30T15:39:00.000Z	meepo	DJones	that's ok. you did misunderstand but thanks for trying :)
