2011-10-08T18:21:00.000Z	nicjasno		i have this p4 computer, and installed 11.04 on it
2011-10-08T18:21:00.000Z	nicjasno		after i rebooted the computer doesn't want to go past the post screen and doesn't even go into bios
2011-10-08T18:22:00.000Z	nicjasno		i repeated this with 3 hard drives, always the same result
