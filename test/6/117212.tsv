2007-05-26T13:21:00.000Z	Polygon89		Does anyone have a problem with totem not playing dvds right? I mean that when you put the dvd, totem auto plays them (but without menus) but then when you restart the dvd manually using totem it says it cant find the codecs, but they are installed and VLC plays them fine.

2007-05-26T13:23:00.000Z	Znuff	Polygon89	VLC has it's own internal codecs. It doesn't use 3rd party codecs.
2007-05-26T13:24:00.000Z	Znuff	Polygon89	your doing something wrong.
2007-05-26T13:26:00.000Z	Znuff	Polygon89	did you try another DVD?
2007-05-26T13:26:00.000Z	Polygon89	Znuff	it does this with like 6 dvd's ive tried.
