2006-07-30T08:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	idefix	probaly just a different termianl app - possibly Eterm or urxvt or aterm or... whatever
2006-07-30T08:59:00.000Z	idefix	thoreauputic	it should all be in the history of my PC, shouldn't it?
2006-07-30T08:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	idefix	what do you mean ?
2006-07-30T09:37:00.000Z	idefix	thoreauputic	little late, so then my friend probably used some sort of "my commands won't be detected-shell"
2007-01-18T09:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	idefix	probably - but it's off-topic here :)
