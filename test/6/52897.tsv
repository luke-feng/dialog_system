2011-02-27T04:00:00.000Z	audifahrer	guntbert	maybe, but if I step into my dbus application the stack strace shows beginning from dbus functions only ?? and line 0. This means normal no symbols, not dependant if sources are available or not.
2011-02-27T04:02:00.000Z	guntbert	audifahrer	sorry, I obviously know much less than you do about the issue
2011-02-27T04:04:00.000Z	audifahrer	guntbert	you told, there's a dbg package: see my list: http://imagebin.org/140085
2011-02-27T04:04:00.000Z	audifahrer	guntbert	do you see it?
2011-02-27T04:05:00.000Z	audifahrer	guntbert	but thanks anyway...
