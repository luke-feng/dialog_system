2010-07-22T18:56:00.000Z	babzog		Hopefully a quick Q.
2010-07-22T18:57:00.000Z	babzog		I am trying to compile a program (C) that links against md5.  I cannot find this lib on ubuntu 10.04... what package do I need to install to get the md5 lib for C?
2010-07-22T18:58:00.000Z	babzog		I need libmd5.so
2010-07-22T18:58:00.000Z	Kwpolska	babzog	search for libmd5-devel or something that contains md5 and devel
