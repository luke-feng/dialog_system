2006-09-30T15:11:00.000Z	woekele	yoshiznit123	do you know how to change the mode its running in? I keep getting "out of range" on my monitor untill X loads, then it works fine.
2006-09-30T15:13:00.000Z	yoshiznit123	woekele	you can change it temporarily from when you boot, press 'e' when ubuntu is selected, find the line that starts with 'kernel', press 'e' again and edit the end (vga=792,791,etc.), then 'b' to boot (http://shrimpworks.za.net/2005/01/31/change-your-console-resolution-and-colour-depth/)
