2012-03-07T03:27:00.000Z	newtony2		can anyone explain to me git? please?
2012-03-07T03:28:00.000Z	newtony2		nothing other than it is used to host source code and you can clone and edit the source
2012-03-07T03:30:00.000Z	newtony2		so if i wanted to install python on ios is would use the git to download the source then compile it for (i think) ARM
2012-03-07T03:32:00.000Z	pfifo	newtony2	python is so popular I would hope ios has a pre-compiled binary available for install
2012-03-07T03:50:00.000Z	pfifo	newtony2	you wont get any help with that on this channel
2012-03-07T03:51:00.000Z	pfifo	newtony2	search alis bot for an ios related channel
