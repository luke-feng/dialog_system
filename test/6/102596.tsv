2010-06-15T10:49:00.000Z	grumbly	Jordan_U	why is that?  and no, it's an Asus k50
2010-06-15T10:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	grumbly	EFI implementations tend to be more buggy than BIOS implementations, and EFI doesn't really present many advantages over BIOS. Also, most FOSS developers that have to work with EFI dislike it.
2010-06-15T10:51:00.000Z	grumbly	Jordan_U	point well taken... however, how can I discern the efi compatibility of my present laptop?
