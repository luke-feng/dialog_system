2011-05-18T01:30:00.000Z	gebbione		i mean /some/commonappfolder/myapplication
2011-05-18T01:31:00.000Z	gebbione		would you put there also things like the android sdk for instance?

2011-05-18T01:31:00.000Z	gebbione		the android sdk is just a manual thing
2011-05-18T01:32:00.000Z	gebbione	Darael	thanks i think that is what i was after
