2006-09-21T10:46:00.000Z	flicovent		Please, can anyone help getting Ubuntu running on a G3? I am currently using it on a intel box and it worked fine but isn't with the g3.
2006-09-21T10:47:00.000Z	flicovent		Yes. I did.
2006-09-21T10:47:00.000Z	flicovent		G4 might help, tried the support forum but to no availe so far thogh.
2006-09-21T10:48:00.000Z	oskude	flicovent	i wonder if someone even continues to develope ubuntu ppc...
2006-09-21T10:50:00.000Z	flicovent	oskude	lol, I hope so, although it is 1998 hardware that I am working with.
2006-09-21T10:51:00.000Z	oskude	flicovent	i mean, now that apple doesnt use ppc anymore, will there be any new machines (for normal people) that uses ppc ?
