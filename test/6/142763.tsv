2005-12-23T14:24:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		wonders why the Mike_ attitdue..?
2005-12-23T14:25:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		stable means community developed to a relatively bugless environment.. unstable - many bugs.. not yet worked out? I saw a post one about Breezy being rushed.. how can it be rushed if it's stable ?
2005-12-23T14:27:00.000Z	djm62	CaptainMorgan	stable means not changing, and means higher quality control (but this can vary)
2005-12-23T14:27:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	djm62	ok, so bugs arent anything to do with it? it's an unstable environment due to system alterations..?
