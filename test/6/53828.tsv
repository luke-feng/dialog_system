2009-12-20T02:00:00.000Z	lolmac		hi, does anyone know the default music player that comes built in ubuntu 9.10?
2009-12-20T02:00:00.000Z	wgrant	lolmac	Rhythmbox, as with all previous releases.
2009-12-20T02:01:00.000Z	lolmac	wgrant	when it searches for mp3 and wma it doesn't find no codecs this is normal?
2009-12-20T02:01:00.000Z	wgrant	lolmac	No, that's not normal.
2009-12-20T02:04:00.000Z	lolmac	wgrant	is there anyway for me to add music shortcuts to this player?
2009-12-20T02:05:00.000Z	lolmac	wgrant	in other player i could add music shortcuts, because i have 80gb of music, so it was added rapidly, this rhythmbox appears to take a long long time
