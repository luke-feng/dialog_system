2007-10-01T11:20:00.000Z	julian		Hi
2007-10-01T11:21:00.000Z	julian		I get the following message when enter sudo -s: "administrator is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported." but administrator is my only account, does anyone knows how to save my data?
2007-10-01T11:22:00.000Z	krunk-	julian	boot to single user mode and add administrator to the admin group which should be in /etc/sudoers?
2007-10-01T11:22:00.000Z	julian	krunk-	what is the single user mode?
2007-10-01T11:23:00.000Z	krunk-	julian	it basicaly gives you root access, a livecd would work equally well
2007-10-01T11:23:00.000Z	krunk-	julian	boot to livecd, mount the drive, edit /etc/sudoers ensure that the ownership on sudoers is correct, reboot
