2010-02-06T02:54:00.000Z	arand	blakkheim	Well ubuntu is a wannabe sometimes.
2010-02-06T02:54:00.000Z	blakkheim	arand	i agree
2010-04-02T23:56:00.000Z	arand	blakkheim	Ali_: Why not letting the installer partition it automatically, and fyi you'll probably want a /swap, meaning two partitions
2010-04-02T23:56:00.000Z	blakkheim	arand	manual partitioning gives more options and you can have a swap file (no need for an extra partition)
2010-04-02T23:59:00.000Z	arand	blakkheim	Ok, I just figured the simpler the better in this case.
