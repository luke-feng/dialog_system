2005-12-28T13:06:00.000Z	djtansey		are there any options for installing ubuntu without a CD or floppy? I have a PCMCIA harddrive (1GB) and windows. could i install it from windows?

2005-12-28T13:08:00.000Z	djtansey	tonyyarusso	i will look that up. thanks.
2005-12-28T13:11:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	djtansey	Throw me the link if you find something, will ya?
2005-12-28T13:16:00.000Z	djtansey	tonyyarusso	will do. http://marc.herbert.free.fr/linux/win2linstall.html - and http://www.phatlinux.com/ has a window installer. wondering if that allows CD-less installs. then i just just mess with grub to boot from my flash pcmcia drive. i already have grub installed on this machine.. not as familiar with it as i used to be with lilo
