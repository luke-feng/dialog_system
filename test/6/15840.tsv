2010-11-14T02:30:00.000Z	ElNota		Just a quick question: Anybody knows why Canonical doesn't support Xchat? I think there is enough amount of people using it
2010-11-14T02:31:00.000Z	LjL	ElNota	probably because they support xchat-gnome instead
2010-11-14T02:31:00.000Z	ElNota	LjL	But nobody uses it :P
2010-11-14T02:31:00.000Z	LjL	ElNota	not really sure though
2010-11-14T02:31:00.000Z	LjL	ElNota	*shrug*
2010-11-14T02:32:00.000Z	LjL	ElNota	also they support Empathy, which has IRC capabilities. i do realize most people who're actually familiar with IRC prefer an actual IRC client, but i can also sort of see Canonical's stance
