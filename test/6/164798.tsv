2010-10-19T20:54:00.000Z	bcurtiswx_		so if i have an intel 64 bit machine, what architecture do I want for the install?
2010-10-19T20:55:00.000Z	bcurtiswx_		the amd64 will work even if its not AMD ?
2010-10-19T20:55:00.000Z	bcurtiswx_		k thx

2010-10-19T20:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	bcurtiswx_	 may as well use 64bit OS for your 64bit hardware.. Unless you have some reason to need 32bit.
