2005-05-22T13:01:00.000Z	Burgundavia	bluemax	gnome
2005-05-22T13:02:00.000Z	bluemax	Burgundavia	ok... what's a good window manager that would allow me to customize my own desktop right-click menu, including colors and borders of that menu?
2005-05-22T13:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	bluemax	no idea
2005-08-09T14:26:00.000Z	bluemax	Burgundavia	i assume that was for me, thanks
2005-08-09T14:26:00.000Z	Burgundavia	bluemax	yes
