2010-04-01T19:11:00.000Z	maginot	raw_	did you tried #samba?
2010-04-01T19:11:00.000Z	raw_	maginot	#samba is death :/
2010-04-01T19:12:00.000Z	maginot	raw_	there are 118 users there, and there is the right place, or wasn't called #samba
2010-04-01T19:13:00.000Z	raw_	maginot	well, thats what i thought first, but after asking my question some user states that the channel is death :)
