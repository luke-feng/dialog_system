2010-05-30T02:47:00.000Z	acerimmer_	InvaderZim	highly advised but you might want to load a lighter version i.e. LUbuntu
2010-05-30T02:47:00.000Z	InvaderZim	acerimmer_	why ?
2010-05-30T02:47:00.000Z	InvaderZim		you think 2 gb is low?
2010-05-30T02:48:00.000Z	InvaderZim		I've never seen swap being used on my desktop
