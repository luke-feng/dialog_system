2009-05-14T07:32:00.000Z	mogus		A mediawiki running at wiki.ubuntu.org would be ideal
2009-05-14T07:32:00.000Z	jrib	mogus	umm, you know there is a wiki already right?
2009-05-14T07:32:00.000Z	mogus	jrib	there are two, apparently, and both use CamelCase.
2009-05-14T07:33:00.000Z	jrib	mogus	I don't understand what your question is
2009-05-14T07:33:00.000Z	mogus	jrib	which is just silly.
