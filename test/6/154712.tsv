2005-02-20T16:16:00.000Z	blah09		whats it called?
2005-02-20T16:16:00.000Z	blah09		try ./filename
2005-02-20T16:18:00.000Z	blah09		you dont have to run it as root...
2005-02-20T16:18:00.000Z	blah09		as root itll go to opt
2005-02-20T16:19:00.000Z	jatz	blah09	but running the install as a normal user wont allow rw access to /opt, unless theres something different with the way ubuntu is setup?
