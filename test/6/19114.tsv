2010-07-12T04:27:00.000Z	Guest6025		Hi, I played around with Compiz on my Xubuntu, and I was wondering how I can remove it completly to get back to the default window management, I used a terminal command in which made it work, how do I revert it, "compiz --replace"

2010-07-12T04:30:00.000Z	soreau	Guest6025	it's in xfce-menu somewhere IIRC. Also close all other windows before saving your session since it will restart any currently running programs after you relogin

2010-07-12T04:32:00.000Z	soreau	Guest6025	No problem
