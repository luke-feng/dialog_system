2008-04-29T06:40:00.000Z	bazhang	jayb2009	you need something like uck and it would require a remaster of the iso (burning a new iso)
2008-04-29T06:41:00.000Z	jayb2009	bazhang	whats uck
2008-04-29T06:41:00.000Z	bazhang	jayb2009	ubuntu customization kit
2008-04-29T06:42:00.000Z	jayb2009	bazhang	thanks but the iso is not linux its another OS
2008-04-29T06:43:00.000Z	bazhang	jayb2009	well does not really matter what distro--they all have an iteration of it--fedora has constructor or somesuch which distro was it--you can then ask in their channel--trivially easy really
