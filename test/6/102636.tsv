2007-01-14T07:58:00.000Z	Gizmo_the_Great1		Hi. My Mozilla Firefox keeps being automatically updated to a series of 1.5.X releases, but it never gets updated to version 2.0. WHy is that, what do I need to change in my settings for it to do that automatically, and how can I do it manually? 'sudo apt-get upgrade firefox'?
