2009-07-13T14:46:00.000Z	Slart	rootlinuxusr_	or just click a checkbox in gconf-editor
2009-07-13T14:46:00.000Z	Slart	rootlinuxusr_	because gnome only checks for mounted drives in /media .. I think it's hardcoded somewhere
2009-07-13T14:47:00.000Z	Slart	rootlinuxusr_	not sure what the rationale behind it is though.. someone thought it was a good idea?
2009-07-13T14:48:00.000Z	Slart	rootlinuxusr_	you can mount network drives whereever you want.. just put them in your fstab.. it's only the point'n'click way that puts them in /media
2009-07-13T15:08:00.000Z	Slart	rootlinuxusr_	but sure.. you can do it "find" or some other bash stuff as well
