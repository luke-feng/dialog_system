2006-04-13T11:24:00.000Z	darkram		I have a question with Ubuntu, maybe someone can help me?
2006-04-13T11:25:00.000Z	darkram		I'm trying to install the latest NVIDIA drivers. the installer doesnt like gcc 4.0 how can I use a later version?
2006-04-13T11:26:00.000Z	darkram		Yup
2006-04-13T11:26:00.000Z	darkram		The NVIDIA complains about compiling the kernal with gcc 4.0 and wants gcc 3.2(?)
2006-04-13T11:28:00.000Z	Cin	darkram	there are various GCC versions on synaptic. It is possible to uninstall 4.0 and install 3.2 temporarily. Try that?
