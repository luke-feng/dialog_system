2011-08-14T13:43:00.000Z	Benkinooby	babilen	usually i do not, and i also gave him "warning". the point is, that #debian has some very experienced users that might give you a hint in the correct direction.
2011-08-14T13:44:00.000Z	Benkinooby	babilen	in general you are right. but many times when i was not able to find a solution in the bew, or get usefull help here in #ubunut an nice ask in #debian helped me

2011-08-14T13:45:00.000Z	babilen	Benkinooby	I know, I am a regular in #debian -- The point is that we can not help Ubuntu users as we do not know Ubuntu.
2011-08-14T13:48:00.000Z	Benkinooby	babilen	some things are ident in ubuntu and debian and in that case #debian can be very helpful. but again, you're right.
