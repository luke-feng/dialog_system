2007-05-14T13:41:00.000Z	a5benwillis	PriceChild	How can I change the formatting?
2007-06-29T06:53:00.000Z	PriceChild	a5benwillis	if it ain't broke don't fix it
2007-06-29T06:53:00.000Z	PriceChild	a5benwillis	no point in upgrading if its all working fine
2007-06-29T06:54:00.000Z	a5benwillis	PriceChild	True, But FF has some nice wireless features. I can wait I suppose :-)
