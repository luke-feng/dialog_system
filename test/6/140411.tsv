2005-08-28T08:40:00.000Z	kyle_		Tyler: what was your question?
2005-08-28T08:40:00.000Z	TylerE	kyle_	I'm trying to get sata, lvm, and the post-install conf to play nice
2005-08-28T08:41:00.000Z	TylerE	kyle_	basically /etc/init.d/lvm dies during boot, saying it can't find one of the drives, but if I go to the console and manually do the commands to mount the vg, it works fine. but then no post-install conf
