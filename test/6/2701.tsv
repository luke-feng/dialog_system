2012-04-20T16:28:00.000Z	bobweaver	MrWobz	 not sure but maybe adhoc it is called I could 100% be wrong on that one there
2012-04-20T16:30:00.000Z	bobweaver	MrWobz	 do you have any old crappy boxs laying around ?
2012-04-20T16:33:00.000Z	MrWobz	bobweaver	I dont have time to play around unfortunately, and one nic is disabled on the currently colocated box so I need to set it up now or rent a switch which is costly considering i have just two servers
