2007-09-12T13:47:00.000Z	gbw		hello, how can i watch tv with kaffeine, 2 channels on one time?
2007-09-12T13:48:00.000Z	pike_	gbw	might get a quicker response in #kubuntu
2007-09-12T13:49:00.000Z	gbw	pike_	i will give it a try, but actually, it is ok if i use other software, do you know any software?
2007-09-12T13:51:00.000Z	pike_	gbw	i dont know what youre doing exactly but ive never really liked kaffine (i might be in the minority there though) you could try i suppose vlc
2007-09-12T13:52:00.000Z	gbw	pike_	i want to watch channel 1 and channel 2 on the same time, because soccers plays on different channels, i want to watch both :)
2007-09-12T13:53:00.000Z	gbw	pike_	do you know does it depend on card or software?
