2010-09-29T18:28:00.000Z	spajderix		I'm about to buy Lestar MD-800E ups, which is supported by Nut, but I don't have any rs232 connect ports, and i still want to use nut to manage this ups. Are there any possible solutions?
2010-09-29T18:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	spajderix	you could buy a usb to rs232 converter I guess
2010-09-29T18:30:00.000Z	spajderix	sacarlson	do you know any producer that sell such device supported by linux?
2010-09-29T18:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	spajderix	you can check this out http://blog.mypapit.net/2008/05/how-to-use-usb-serial-port-converter-in-ubuntu.html
