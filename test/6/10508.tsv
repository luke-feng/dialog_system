2012-11-09T00:29:00.000Z	Chamunks		is there any way to re-enable middle click scrolling?
2012-11-09T00:29:00.000Z	Chamunks		Where you basically scroll/grab the page by just middle clicking and way you go?
2012-11-09T00:30:00.000Z	Chamunks		I've asked this here like 5 times on different days and no one has made one single comment about it.  Am I really the only person who misses this?
2012-11-09T00:30:00.000Z	gdea73	Chamunks	I agree, but I don't know of any solution
2012-11-09T00:34:00.000Z	gdea73	Chamunks	it has an adblock extension, FYI
2012-11-09T00:35:00.000Z	Chamunks	gdea73	it just took 5 years to get the extension.
