2009-12-16T10:30:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46		ianm_:-) Hmmm, compiz?  I will check, thanks
2009-12-16T10:31:00.000Z	soreau	Lostinspace_46	The Window Manager is responsible for that behavior. Default window manager in gnome is metacity, but you can use compiz or any other for that matter. It should be noted only one window manager can be used at any given time
2009-12-16T10:48:00.000Z	soreau	Lostinspace_46	Your icons are controlled by nautilus, not the window manager. and I don't know enough about nautilus to say if you can tell it where to place it's icon
