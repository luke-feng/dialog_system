2005-04-10T07:31:00.000Z	fissy	kpeterson	the line needs to look like this: Modes           "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "720x350" "640x480"
2005-04-10T07:31:00.000Z	kpeterson	fissy	I think that line is right, but my monitor section is different from what I saw when i booted the live version, so im gonna try to edit that
