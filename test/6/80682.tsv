2007-10-11T13:08:00.000Z	nanonyme		but you have to be a programmer to get a free CAD :)
2007-10-11T13:09:00.000Z	angasule	nanonyme	I'm actually a programmer and I've done quite a bit of 3D stuff :P
2007-10-11T13:09:00.000Z	nanonyme	angasule	that is, there are tools to help you write a CAD program for yourself
2007-10-11T13:11:00.000Z	angasule	nanonyme	any in particular? :?
2007-10-11T13:12:00.000Z	nanonyme	angasule	i don't know myself, a friend (not a programmer) bumped into some while trying to find a CAD for linux
