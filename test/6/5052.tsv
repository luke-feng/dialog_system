2011-11-26T22:22:00.000Z	sovzed		hello, i am pretty new to linux. I just installed 11.10 and some apps, like irssi. I know how to execute them but, I would like to know how can i create shortcuts for my desktop/left bar. I really couldnt find any explanation on something that simple, i guess everyone knows that but i dont :P
2011-11-26T22:24:00.000Z	sovzed		so you guys always start applications from a terminal?
