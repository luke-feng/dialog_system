2008-01-18T22:05:00.000Z	tim167	MrObvious	the the destination drive must be bigger than the actual source drive, or just the source partition ?
2008-01-18T22:05:00.000Z	MrObvious	tim167	I think dd does whole drives, not just partitions.
2008-01-18T22:11:00.000Z	tim167	MrObvious	ok thanks, have to look for a bigger drive then...
