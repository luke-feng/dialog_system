2009-01-13T23:06:00.000Z	Damaki		I'm new to Ubuntu, I've just installed 8.10 on my desktop but I can't connect to a wireless network since I can't for the life of me find the option to do so. Right clicking on the Network Manager in the top taskbar gives me the option to edit connections which I have done, but there's no option to actually connect to the network.
2009-01-13T23:06:00.000Z	Damaki		The help file tells me to go to System -> Administration -> Network
2009-01-13T23:06:00.000Z	Damaki		But that option does not exist in the Administration menu
2009-01-13T23:06:00.000Z	pyrokay_	Damaki	is your wireless card working?
2009-01-13T23:07:00.000Z	pyrokay_	Damaki	i'm not sure. try ifconfig
