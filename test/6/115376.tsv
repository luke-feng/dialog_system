2006-06-27T05:54:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		as far as this router exploit goes....beyond downloading a firmware update (which doesn't exist for my router), is there any way to configure a router to eliminate that problem?
2006-06-27T05:54:00.000Z	mikere	Geoffrey2	which router exploit?
2006-06-27T05:55:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		um, the one that just knocked about two dozen people off of irc?
2006-06-27T05:56:00.000Z	mikere	Geoffrey2	was more interested in what kind of router was vulnerable =)
2006-06-27T05:59:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	mikere	I'm not sure...obviously my router....this is the second time I've been in here when there's been a mass kockoff of people....last time I was one of them....both times people have said "fix your router", but when asked how...dead silence.....
2006-06-27T06:01:00.000Z	mikere	Geoffrey2	was asking because I've had connection problems with my ISP and the ISP support guy had me shut down modem, router and all computers and then bring up modem first, then router - wouldn't work with modem restart.  Suspecting a problem with my router as well
