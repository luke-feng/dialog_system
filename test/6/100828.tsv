2007-01-29T15:27:00.000Z	pbureau		linux_kid- usb or normal ps2 ?
2007-01-29T15:27:00.000Z	pbureau		linux_kid- and it does this when you plug it into the keyboard or pc?
2007-01-29T15:29:00.000Z	linux_kid	pbureau	it plugs into the PC and starts acting up the keyboard, it fixes by changing the keyboard layout in settings, but i was wondering if there was another solution
2007-01-29T15:33:00.000Z	linux_kid	pbureau	thanks for your help
2007-01-29T15:35:00.000Z	linux_kid	pbureau	i was checking the forums, sorry, didnt see you saythat.  I dont have any other usb mice and no ps/2 ports on my laptop... so i dont know
2007-01-29T15:37:00.000Z	linux_kid	pbureau	it only happens the first time i plug it in per session ( i do a lot w/ XP so i hibernate alot)
