So it's possible to run application started on the computer and then remote them from one session (one Window)

2006-06-29T10:25:00.000Z	Zambezi	jldugger_	I where in the SSH-session and puschde Ctrl+Alt+F1 and I got a new terminal. I thought everything fucked up, but I were lucky. I played music so I knew it worked and I tried and tried and finaly I got back.
