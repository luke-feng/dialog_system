2010-06-02T19:28:00.000Z	blue_anna	totalnub	wow, what's your application?
2010-06-02T19:29:00.000Z	totalnub	blue_anna	my application is trading related
2010-06-02T19:29:00.000Z	blue_anna	totalnub	try nv instead of nvidia with the xcinemajig and see if it is still eating up all the ram ? I dunno how to do that :)
2010-06-02T19:30:00.000Z	totalnub	blue_anna	nv is the opensource preinstalled driver no? if so, xinerama doesn't work
2010-06-02T19:32:00.000Z	blue_anna	totalnub	yea that's right -- ok, I was just thinking nv is the one that comes with the system so it might work better with xinerama :P -- good luck
