2009-11-05T22:15:00.000Z	motoh		Yes, sorry.
2009-11-05T22:16:00.000Z	motoh		niel127 basically if I have ACPI on, udev hangs my boot for six to ten minutes trying to load my ATI card (which comes up fine without udev's interference, the proprietary driver works fine) but with it off, I have no volume control.

2009-11-05T22:18:00.000Z	motoh	insm0d	that's a fine start, I'll start researching.
