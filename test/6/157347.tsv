2005-01-17T14:16:00.000Z	neenee	crimsun	well, the installer was no problem since i knew it from debian. it's just that i had to mess with universe and such before i could get the packages i wanted
2005-01-17T14:17:00.000Z	neenee	crimsun	as soon as i have X up and running with my settings i have a backup of, i probably won't complain anymore.
2005-01-17T14:17:00.000Z	crimsun	neenee	they're separated into those repos based on support and licenses
2005-01-17T14:17:00.000Z	neenee	crimsun	i know. debian probably has the same arrangement
