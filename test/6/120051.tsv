2006-04-23T14:45:00.000Z	AAA	ggilbert	 that is very true. there is a lot of drama with the debian maintainers, I think the ubuntu team has done a remarkable job in that area
2006-04-23T14:48:00.000Z	AAA	ggilbert	 and chock full of modules, but that is another debate. "vim or emacs for ya sir"...
2006-04-23T14:51:00.000Z	AAA	ggilbert	 that is an odd digression
2006-04-23T14:52:00.000Z	ggilbert	AAA	there was a method to my madness. I didnt like what Redhat did with 7.0, so I swapped to debian. Then I got frustrated with the last year of the woody release proccess, so I switched to Gentoo, then I got tired of compiling stuff. :)
2006-04-23T14:54:00.000Z	AAA	ggilbert	 I agree, I have been dinking around with it for over a year, but I still like doing a 10m netinst and grabbing a few apps and leaving the box to work
