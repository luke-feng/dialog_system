2011-08-29T03:45:00.000Z	Lasers	Hasham	Correct.
2011-08-29T03:46:00.000Z	Hasham	Lasers	 so unity only..?
2011-08-29T03:47:00.000Z	Lasers	Hasham	Yes, Unity (or Unity 2D for slower machines). If you don't like it, consider looking at alternatives.
2011-08-29T03:48:00.000Z	Hasham	Lasers	 i knid of like it despite its bugs . but there should be an option of gnome 3
2011-08-29T03:50:00.000Z	Lasers	Hasham	That's not in the plan. Ubuntu created Unity. Gnome create Gnome3. You can try Gnome3 using PPA or different distro.
