Input from the screen works fine as far as moving the pointer etc, but whenever I move the mouse it sends a nonstop stream of clicks to that coordinate - making using a virtual keyboard near impossible.  Any thoughts?

2008-08-08T12:28:00.000Z	feaster83	coffinzm	did you try(test) an other mouse device?
2008-08-08T12:29:00.000Z	feaster83	coffinzm	but what mouse does give the problem?
