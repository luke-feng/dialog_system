2007-12-07T01:04:00.000Z	peter77	pike_	I'm running Ubuntu/windows on a Toshiba Satellite Pro A120 Laptop computer, when I plug my headphones into the jack on the front whilst running linux the speakers do not mute but when I plug the headphones in whilst running windows the speakers DO mute, therefore I beleive this is an issue with alsa and am wondering if there is a fix available?
