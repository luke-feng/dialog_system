2009-05-11T02:40:00.000Z	bc		I'm curious, has anyone that's using a vcs moved to git from svn due to disk space usage?
2009-05-11T02:40:00.000Z	Eevee	bc	$work is in the process of doing so yes
2009-05-11T02:41:00.000Z	bc	Eevee	apparently the disk space saved is quite incredible
2009-05-11T02:41:00.000Z	Eevee	bc	yeah, and it's much faster too.  git is pretty cool; I've been using it for personal stuff for a few months now
2009-05-11T02:42:00.000Z	bc	Eevee	I may switch
2009-05-11T02:43:00.000Z	Eevee	bc	doubt you'll regret it!
