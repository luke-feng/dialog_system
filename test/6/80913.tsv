2008-09-11T00:56:00.000Z	babo		firefox quite often hogs 100% of my cpu for 20-30 second periods. The mem is at about 16%. What's so cpu intensive for FF ? I'm not doing anything special in it ? It's not even loading new pages sometimes ...
2008-09-11T00:58:00.000Z	babo		cut down on resources ? I'm not using swap, and I'm only using a fraction of memory ...
2008-09-11T00:58:00.000Z	babo		shouldn't be a memory or resources leak ...
2008-09-11T00:59:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	babo	ff2 could eat my 320mb system ram in about nine hours.
2008-09-11T01:00:00.000Z	babo	Rabbitbunny	yeah, i used to get that as well. it doesn't seem to be as bad anymore though ...
2008-09-11T01:00:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	babo	nah, ff3 fixed whatever it was.
