2006-01-23T10:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evangelos	 you are refering to a  fairly normal computer crt monitor? or a LCD one?
2006-01-23T10:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evangelos	 may want to try a different live cd - the Ubuntu one - is not as up to date as say Knoppix.
2006-01-23T10:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evangelos	 the live cd's have dozens of boot time options - check the ubuntu wiki/forums for details.. same with Knoppix - they use about the same options. Google for knoppix
2006-01-23T10:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	evangelos	 googling for 'ubuntu wiki' :P or read the topic. it has the url.
