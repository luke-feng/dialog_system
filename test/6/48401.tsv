2008-11-11T02:51:00.000Z	gavagai		I installed rar and unrar but still can't get extraction to work.  What do I need to do to unpack rar archives?
2008-11-11T02:51:00.000Z	BULLE_	gavagai	unrar
2008-11-11T02:51:00.000Z	BULLE_	gavagai	and dont use the free version, thats called unrar-free
2008-11-11T02:52:00.000Z	BULLE_	gavagai	or something along those lines, the free oversion doesnt work well at all
2008-11-11T02:52:00.000Z	BULLE_	gavagai	does unrar evne come with a gui ?
2008-11-11T02:53:00.000Z	gavagai	BULLE_	i googled this and it said if you install unrar it would make the default file extracter work with rar
