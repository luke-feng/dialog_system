2005-04-05T13:27:00.000Z	black_Nightmare		the vga port is usually mirroring only I believe
2005-04-05T13:28:00.000Z	aquarius	black_Nightmare	really? Oh. X doesn't support different resolutions on the two monitors?
2005-04-05T13:29:00.000Z	aquarius	black_Nightmare	bummer. :) I am denied.
2005-04-05T13:39:00.000Z	aquarius	black_Nightmare	I can't imagine why it would be a problem, unless you switch while it's in the middle of working out what your keyboard is...
2005-04-05T13:40:00.000Z	aquarius	black_Nightmare	probably. But if you're worried about it then don't do it; I could well be wrong, because I'm just guessing...
