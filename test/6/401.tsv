2012-10-29T04:37:00.000Z	schmitt9531	PatrickDickey	Are you familiar with ubuntu's default setup with qemu+kvm?
2012-10-29T04:37:00.000Z	schmitt9531		I'm having issues with qemu:///session trying to connect to the qemu system libvirt daemon
2012-10-29T04:38:00.000Z	PatrickDickey	schmitt9531	no, i'm not. I've never actually tried quemu or kvm. I always use third party stuff like Virtualbox or VMWare.
