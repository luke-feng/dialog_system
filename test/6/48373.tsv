2008-11-15T08:18:00.000Z	exmachina	fryguy	the problem is, wine thinks my .exe is a data file
2008-11-15T08:18:00.000Z	fryguy	exmachina	so run it from a command line
2008-11-15T08:19:00.000Z	exmachina	fryguy	what do you mean? I did wine setup.exe and it tells me it's a bad EXE
2008-11-15T08:20:00.000Z	fryguy	exmachina	no idea
