2012-11-16T22:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp		it's like something from the 1980s
2012-11-16T22:59:00.000Z	RJ45	gordonjcp	correct-ish, but 10.04.4 on the other hand rocks!
2012-11-16T22:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	RJ45	but, that's just my opinion
2012-11-16T22:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	RJ45	no, it's horrible, I couldn't wait to get rid of 10.04
2012-11-16T22:59:00.000Z	RJ45	gordonjcp	ur clueless.
