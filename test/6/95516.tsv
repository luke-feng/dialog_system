2008-07-11T18:33:00.000Z	Brandon__		oh nevermind ping works

2008-07-11T18:34:00.000Z	Brandon__		yeah. So odd. Okay I have internet and I have SSH installed. I've set up like 3 servers now. This is the first time I've had a problem. I can't SSH into the darn thing. Anyone know how to diagnose a problem like this?
