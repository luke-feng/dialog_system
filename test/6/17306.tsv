2010-09-08T03:41:00.000Z	maco	jsninja	ugh that doc is full of rudeness
2010-09-08T03:42:00.000Z	jsninja	maco	?
2010-09-08T03:42:00.000Z	maco	jsninja	read that recently? its not a very nice howto...
2010-09-08T03:42:00.000Z	maco	jsninja	anyway, OptiplexGX620's question makes perfect sense
2010-09-08T03:44:00.000Z	jsninja	maco	sure his question makes some sense. But complaining loudly that hes not getting instant free help and making statements such as "help me or else I'll move to some other variation of linux" is full of rudeness. And could certainly take something from that howto, despite its flaws.
2010-09-08T03:44:00.000Z	maco	jsninja	eh he said he'd go to a different version of ubuntu... the one i prefer ;-_
