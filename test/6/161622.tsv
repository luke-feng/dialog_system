2004-11-02T07:20:00.000Z	|trey|	elvstone	those are in developement afaik
2004-11-02T07:21:00.000Z	elvstone	|trey|	the translations? i'm aware of that, but aren't the translations in work available somewhere?
2004-11-02T07:21:00.000Z	|trey|	elvstone	not entirely sure, don't know where...
2004-11-02T07:21:00.000Z	elvstone	|trey|	i'm interested in fixing some things with the swedish translation (which is OK in standard gnome, but a bit broken on ubuntu).
2004-11-02T07:22:00.000Z	elvstone	|trey|	it's weird how they say you can help out but they don't have their changes in public anywhere..
