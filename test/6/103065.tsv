2006-11-04T09:24:00.000Z	reiki	heisgreg	I just meant it wasn't quite as stable as Dapper. And it required more of my attention and I am NOT a linux guru.
2006-11-04T09:25:00.000Z	heisgreg		haha, I have been running XGL and Compiz, so sability isn't really an issue for me :)
2006-11-04T09:25:00.000Z	reiki	heisgreg	I did xgl/compiz in dapper but found I could not run an openGL game
2006-11-04T09:26:00.000Z	heisgreg	reiki	I don't know about games but my openGL screen savers seem to work fine.
2006-11-04T09:27:00.000Z	reiki	heisgreg	yeah I kinda liked the eye candy, but I have only one game I play regularly in wine and it wouldn't run... so xgl had to go (*sniff*)
