2009-05-13T03:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	liquid	 what filesystem is the drive? and how did you mount it?
2009-05-13T03:27:00.000Z	liquid	Dr_Willis	it is ext4 and it mounted automatically after I restarted
2009-05-13T03:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	liquid	 for linux native filesystems the directories must be 'owned' by the user you wish to access teh device..  use fstab to mount it where you want, then either chown the mountpoint, or chown any directroies on teh drive.
2009-05-13T03:29:00.000Z	liquid	Dr_Willis	okay thanks, I will give that a shot
