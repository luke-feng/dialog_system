2009-03-03T13:06:00.000Z	Madkiss_		I am experiencing massive problems with latest nvidia-drivers in intrepid, basically, i can not start KDE because I see all different kinds of KDE applications crash with SIGSEV11
2009-03-03T13:06:00.000Z	Madkiss_		is this a known problem and is a fix available for it?
2009-03-03T13:07:00.000Z	Madkiss_		no, it's all packages stuff.
