2008-05-13T07:02:00.000Z	rickJames		I am trying to run the 8.04 live cd and once i get past hte options i get "out of range" on my monitor. after attempting to change the vga settigns manually, i've come to ask for suggestions
2008-05-13T07:03:00.000Z	thingfish	rickJames	what all have you done?
2008-05-13T07:03:00.000Z	rickJames	thingfish	other than the vga (f4) option nothing. i'm at a loss
2008-05-13T07:07:00.000Z	thingfish	rickJames	8.04 doesn't make it easy on us.  They took away our prime tool for configuring display.
2008-05-13T07:08:00.000Z	rickJames	thingfish	: it appears tokenbad (who i was helping too) has found some one who is working on it with him. thank you for your time :)
2008-05-13T07:08:00.000Z	thingfish	rickJames	what tools are available, require a gui.  Which of course you don't have. :)
