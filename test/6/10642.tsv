2011-04-27T00:46:00.000Z	iku-iku		i have the following problem: i installed ubuntu as my second OS. After configuring thunderbird to use the same profile in ubuntu as in windows, I shut down the computer and booted under windows. Thunderbird, which opens at startup wanted me to create a new profile, then windows didn't respond anymore, not even task manager.Therefore I wanted to shut down my computer and pressed the power button. Unfortunately I didn't pressed it long
