2012-04-27T01:39:00.000Z	marcusk	samster34_	yes
2012-04-27T01:40:00.000Z	marcusk	samster34_	just skip that part of it
2012-04-27T01:40:00.000Z	samster34_	marcusk	how do I ttell it to stop asking me for an archive mirror
2012-04-27T01:41:00.000Z	marcusk	samster34_	could be that the standard installer does that, if I remember correct you can at least skip it if you select expert install but now I'm not really sure
2012-04-27T01:42:00.000Z	samster34_	marcusk	I can "select the next in the install process"...but none of the options are "just install it already!"
