2011-08-13T10:16:00.000Z	willwh	rodhash	how much memory do you have? not much?
2011-08-13T10:17:00.000Z	rodhash	willwh	2GB (total), but my BIOs doesn't say the amount for video... my laptop uses a intel display card (on-board)
2011-08-13T10:18:00.000Z	willwh		oh, interesting.
2011-08-13T10:19:00.000Z	rodhash		So .. I'm allocating 200MB for video through some grub's option... Buuuut I'm not so sure how much should I allocate for video..
2011-08-13T10:20:00.000Z	willwh	rodhash	128 is probably more than sufficient
