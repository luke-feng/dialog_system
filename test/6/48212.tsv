2012-05-02T06:15:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	FloridaGuy	DeviantArt/Blogs - personally I figured out how to install compiz and a converted fallback theme to make it look like 10.4 :P
2012-05-02T06:17:00.000Z	FloridaGuy	Gaming4JC	ok i'll give devart a shot i forgot about them... How's that theme look
2012-05-02T06:18:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	FloridaGuy	Nice and more functional for me at least - http://pleasanthacking.com/2012/01/02/making-ubuntu-11-10-and-12-04-behave-like-10-04/
2012-05-02T06:20:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	FloridaGuy	The best part is compiz works (though not all features [3D Cube broke...]) so I can still have wobbly windows! :)
2012-05-02T06:22:00.000Z	FloridaGuy	Gaming4JC	as long as you like it. thats what counts
