2007-03-23T07:16:00.000Z	rasputnik	binary0	do an 'apt-get install build-essential'
2007-03-23T07:17:00.000Z	rasputnik	binary0	you'll still need some extra packages - depends what you will be linking against
2007-03-23T07:17:00.000Z	binary0	rasputnik	ok, lemme get that install done then i'll check whats next
