2009-08-02T02:13:00.000Z	edbian	mac9416	System -> Preferences -> Remote Desktop
2009-08-02T02:14:00.000Z	mac9416	edbian	I enable, it says "Your desktop is only reachable over the local network. Others can access your computer using the address localhost."
2009-08-02T02:14:00.000Z	edbian	mac9416	yeah so...
2009-08-02T02:14:00.000Z	mac9416	edbian	how do I enable over the Internet? :-)
2009-08-02T02:14:00.000Z	edbian	mac9416	I thought we'd get to this :)
