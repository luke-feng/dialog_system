2008-10-26T05:15:00.000Z	Luria	complexity	perhaps the mount incorrectly determined filesystem type?
2008-10-26T05:16:00.000Z	complexity	Luria	it is vfat
2008-10-26T05:18:00.000Z	complexity	Luria	I do mount -t vfat /dev/sdc1 /mnt/camera
2008-10-26T05:21:00.000Z	Luria	complexity	what pray tell, did they do, shorted fstab a bit?
