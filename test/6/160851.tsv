2004-11-11T08:18:00.000Z	timothy	netmonk	I'd be no help with anything network related about it, though -- I think the PCMCIA slots are dead on the Satellite.
2004-11-11T08:25:00.000Z	timothy	netmonk	hmmm. Does your help require Ubuntu to be *installed* on the laptop, or just running? I think that ACPI questions would only be applicable to a system with Ubuntu installed, sadly.
2004-11-11T08:26:00.000Z	timothy	netmonk	rather
2004-11-11T08:26:00.000Z	netmonk	timothy	yes, Ubuntu is running fine, I can't get stand-by to work
2004-11-11T08:26:00.000Z	timothy	netmonk	Ah, I don't think I can be any help to you on that front, then, sorry.
