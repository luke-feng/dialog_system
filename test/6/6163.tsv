2011-10-14T07:24:00.000Z	popsch		I upgraded to oneiric four days ago. since then update-manager has never shown me any packages that would need upgrading. am I missing something?
2011-10-14T07:26:00.000Z	dajhorn	popsch	Probably not.  Not much changed this week.  My update log says that Monday was the last time anything in the base system changed.
2011-10-14T07:26:00.000Z	popsch	dajhorn	hm. a pity, because I experience lots of bugs with nautilus
2011-10-14T07:27:00.000Z	popsch	dajhorn	but overall it's working :-) the bleeding edge.
2011-10-14T07:27:00.000Z	dajhorn	popsch	I had to suck it up and learn XFCE.  I couldn't get GNOME the way I wanted it.
2011-10-14T07:28:00.000Z	popsch	dajhorn	I think 11.10 looks gorgeous with the theme and the cleaned up nautilus. I like it
