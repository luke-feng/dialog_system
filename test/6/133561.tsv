2009-10-07T09:51:00.000Z	godstar		Good point.
2009-10-07T09:52:00.000Z	godstar		Thank you both.
2009-10-07T09:54:00.000Z	godstar		Wow, not even crickets chirping when I asked about Karmic64 in +1 room. :D
2009-10-07T09:56:00.000Z	godstar		Anyone Ubuntu IRC Members here?
2009-10-07T09:58:00.000Z	carpediem	godstar	I had equally silent responses to my Karmic questions in +1, so much so I just don't bother
