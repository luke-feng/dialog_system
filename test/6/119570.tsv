2008-11-27T02:28:00.000Z	PatrickBic		am i allowed the ubuntu logo in my own software logo (= gpl software)?
2008-11-27T02:29:00.000Z	ompaul	PatrickBic	you need to talk with canonical.com they own the trademark and gpl does not cover trademarks even gnu is a trademark
2008-11-27T02:29:00.000Z	PatrickBic	ompaul	email'ing them with a description+logo-idea is enough?
2008-11-27T02:30:00.000Z	ompaul	PatrickBic	not qualified for discussion on this subject, please talk to them
2008-11-27T02:36:00.000Z	PatrickBic	ompaul	mailed them ;).. thanks again :)
