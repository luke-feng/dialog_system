2010-02-11T05:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	Karhu	audacious is like xmms, even can use xmms skins
2010-02-11T05:05:00.000Z	Karhu	ardchoille	im using KDE and i already have xmms2 installed
2010-02-11T05:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	Karhu	KDE? You should be in #kubuntu then
2010-02-11T05:06:00.000Z	Karhu	ardchoille	kubuntu always seems empty when i go there
2010-02-11T05:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	Karhu	Regardless, this channel is for Ubuntu support.. you need to be in a channel that supports your distro
