2006-10-25T16:29:00.000Z	dek		what is the command for uncompressing a .tar.bz2 file?
2006-10-25T16:29:00.000Z	LjL	dek	tar xf filename
2008-04-17T06:23:00.000Z	LjL	dek	are you sure the makefile isn't borked?
2008-04-17T06:24:00.000Z	dek	LjL	i made the makefile myself, it works in my Ubuntu but I am trying to compile it in a virtual machine with Slackware :P
2008-04-17T06:26:00.000Z	LjL	dek	does "make" alone without any makefile even work? (i suppose not, which means the problem is with the make executable itself)
2008-04-17T06:27:00.000Z	dek	LjL	yeah, it doesnt work
