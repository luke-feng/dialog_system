2011-08-09T04:30:00.000Z	maalac	edbian	hmm. i've downloaded its alpha 3 version. 11.04 lots of problems..
2011-08-09T04:30:00.000Z	edbian	maalac	what?
2011-08-09T04:31:00.000Z	maalac	edbian	i don't want to go through 11.04. coz my laptop freezes on boot ..
2011-08-09T04:32:00.000Z	edbian	maalac	Then just wait until october when 11.10 comes out
