2007-11-28T20:58:00.000Z	ikonia	ScislaC	via xorg direction program
2007-11-28T21:00:00.000Z	ScislaC	ikonia	is there a way for me to configure it somehow? Xgl won't start because it thinks my driver is '' (literally empty quotes in the log)
2007-11-28T21:01:00.000Z	ikonia	ScislaC	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
