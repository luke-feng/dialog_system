2011-04-27T21:22:00.000Z	pindropper		When i launch an application using the terminal, by typing say gedit ~/.bashrc, my terminal doesnt let me type anything further until the application (gedit in this case) is closed. if i force exit the hung prompt by ctrl+z, the launched application greys out and becomes unresponsive. is this normal? and if so, do i have to keep opening new terminals to do other things while having launched...
