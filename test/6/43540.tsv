2009-02-04T00:07:00.000Z	TelQuel		hey, my firefox is not working well at all and I am trying to uninstall it and reinstall but I can't get it to uninstall... I also tried to download/use konqueror but couldn't get it to work. FireFox won't play youtube videos and the bkac/forward button is broken.
2009-02-04T00:08:00.000Z	TelQuel		I would search google but since my only internet browser doesn't work...
2009-02-04T00:08:00.000Z	TelQuel		I tried to use another browser but it didn't work, neither konq nor opera would probably install
2009-02-04T00:09:00.000Z	TelQuel		Can someone please help me either uninstall firefox or get another browser running so I can actually use the internet? heh.

2009-02-04T00:11:00.000Z	TelQuel	quibbler	I tried to install opera and it didn't install properly for some reason.
