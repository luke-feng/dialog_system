2010-01-28T05:54:00.000Z	Callum_	sagaci	Yeah, you'll need a special Ethernet cable called a crossover cable
2010-01-28T05:55:00.000Z	sagaci	Callum_	are they rare
2010-01-28T05:55:00.000Z	Callum_	sagaci	Not at all
2010-01-28T05:55:00.000Z	sagaci	Callum_	how much roughly
2010-01-28T05:55:00.000Z	Callum_	sagaci	They're not very expensive, probably about the same as regular Ethernet cables
