2007-08-05T12:55:00.000Z	Bobby		Hello, I don't mean to interupt but i am trying to use the update manager in uBuntu to update my os...I have an internet connection (i know), but when it goes to try and perform the updates...it says:     Could not download all repository indexes...then it just quits
2007-08-05T12:55:00.000Z	Bobby		Any idea why?
