2012-09-17T02:19:00.000Z	uberTaco	f2prateek_	the ones in the additional drivers menu are gonna be better ubuntu-supported, but the ones on AMD's support page will be newer
2012-09-17T02:19:00.000Z	uberTaco	f2prateek_	so it's just a matter of picking which route you'd prefer
2012-09-17T02:20:00.000Z	f2prateek_	uberTaco	ActionParsnip: thanks, I was just wondering if anyone has some experience with either and which one they would recommend
2012-09-17T02:21:00.000Z	uberTaco	f2prateek_	I'm on a Radeon mobility system. I'm just using the version from the "Additional drivers" menu, no problems so far.
2012-09-17T02:23:00.000Z	f2prateek_	uberTaco	sounds good, thanks
