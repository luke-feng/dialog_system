2009-11-29T03:22:00.000Z	skinnYPuP	newbie002	there are sometimes some freq settings in the monitor's own menu that can help with that..   if you're monitor doesn't you may need some custom mode lines in your xorg file. I recently used a mode line generator i found on google to do so .

2009-11-29T03:24:00.000Z	skinnYPuP	newbie002	make sure to read up on it b4 you dive in. and back up your xorg.conf incase a new modeline you try leaves you with no display
