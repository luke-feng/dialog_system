2007-03-11T08:24:00.000Z	bruenig		it only confuses things
2007-03-11T08:25:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	bruenig	because totem sucks, and calling it totem would make more people realize it   ; )
2007-03-11T08:25:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	bruenig	errr....  VLC.  : )
2007-03-11T08:26:00.000Z	FunnyLookinHat	bruenig	lol, have you ever tried clicking the "list" button.... ?   : )    In any case, VLC isn't included because it supports restricted formats
