2009-12-06T22:00:00.000Z	om26er	WaywardGeek_	ask UNR questions here
2009-12-06T22:01:00.000Z	WaywardGeek_	om26er	Thanks.  I had a Dumb Idea this morning for Remix and I thought I'd test it here first: A dynamically warping virtual keyboard for multi-touch internet tablets.
2009-12-06T22:01:00.000Z	WaywardGeek_	om26er	I wrote up the idea at http://www.billrocks.org
2009-12-06T22:02:00.000Z	WaywardGeek_	om26er	The idea is that when you place 8 fingers down, an keyboard appears, warped to fit your finger placement.  As you type, it adjusts.
2009-12-06T22:03:00.000Z	WaywardGeek_	om26er	Ok.  will do.
