2008-03-22T20:41:00.000Z	unop__	AlienX	i'm not sure of the answer to your question but when doing something as significant as upgrading a system, it'd be best to ensure all data is backed up first, thats a responsibility
2008-03-22T20:42:00.000Z	unop__	AlienX	and if you are upgrading (not doing a fresh install) -- i dont see that being an issue -- but this is not an official stance
2008-03-22T20:43:00.000Z	unop__	AlienX	thats a very windows-ish approach to things :) i find that really to be a complete waste of time
2008-03-22T20:45:00.000Z	unop__	AlienX	i'm not saying its the wrong way to do things -- but you never figured out how to fix things broken in upgrades? :)
