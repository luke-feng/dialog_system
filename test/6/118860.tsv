I can't mount the volume without root permissions and once I do I can't write to the volume without write permissions. Is it ok to delete the filesystem I created that spans the two drives?

2010-01-20T00:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Samp	change the ownership
2010-01-20T00:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Samp	don't worry about that, - can you please pastebin your /etc/fstab please
2010-01-20T00:48:00.000Z	ikonia	Samp	ex3 should be ext3
2010-01-20T01:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Samp	no problem
