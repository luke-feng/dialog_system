2007-01-30T13:17:00.000Z	alecjw	pbureau	one rt61 and one rt2561. they both show up as wlan0 and wmaster0, but dont connect or do anything at all
2007-01-30T13:19:00.000Z	alecjw	pbureau	whay doesnt it work with network-manager? and since the driver's gpl, why isnt it included in ubuntu?
2007-01-30T13:20:00.000Z	alecjw	pbureau	what about the firmware they supply on the website?
2007-01-30T13:22:00.000Z	alecjw	pbureau	and can i do that tutorial without the card plugged in, up until the last step?
2007-01-30T13:28:00.000Z	alecjw	pbureau	ok. thanks for your help
