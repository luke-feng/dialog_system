2008-01-07T13:06:00.000Z	talon223		i've never had a prob burning ubuntu...and my burner is horrible...
2008-01-07T13:06:00.000Z	bulmer	talon223	my burner says it does 16x, i cant even get 3kb to slow down to 1x
2008-01-07T13:07:00.000Z	talon223	bulmer	wow.....so it wants to speed up on you? or what..
2008-01-07T13:08:00.000Z	bulmer	talon223	i just close my eyes and hopes for the best when i burn with 3kb..sometimes i luck out, mostly not..you want some coasters?
2008-01-07T13:09:00.000Z	talon223	bulmer	oh, you meant k3b...yeah...i think that's the prog that speeds it up to the max. available speed...
2008-01-07T13:10:00.000Z	bulmer	talon223	i tried to set gnomebaker burn speed and cant seem to do it from the gui..dont know the command line behind it
