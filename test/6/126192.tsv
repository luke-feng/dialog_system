2006-06-14T09:40:00.000Z	mngrif		this livecd crap isn't cutting it
2006-06-14T09:40:00.000Z	slavik	mngrif	no it isn't
2006-06-14T09:42:00.000Z	slavik	mngrif	don't blame the livecd ...
2006-06-14T09:42:00.000Z	mngrif	slavik	it would be different if it included a text installer
2006-06-14T09:43:00.000Z	mngrif	slavik	it would also be different if the website told you the differences
