2011-08-06T00:27:00.000Z	ironm		good evening - can you give me a tip please where to find a howto for creating debian packages from Ubuntu's git-repositories? - Thank you in advance
2011-08-06T00:27:00.000Z	wols	ironm	do these git repos give you a debian/ directory when you pull them?
2011-08-06T00:29:00.000Z	ironm	wols	what is the git's url ?
2011-08-06T00:29:00.000Z	wols	ironm	how would I know. You talked about them. I don't even know if they exist
2011-08-06T00:30:00.000Z	ironm	wols	I guess they should exist ;)
2011-08-06T00:30:00.000Z	wols	ironm	you need to recheck your guesses
