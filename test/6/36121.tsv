2009-08-24T07:37:00.000Z	slide		Im trying to mount a samba share from my server on my ubuntu desktop. On the server, I have it setup so ONLY guest can access the share so there should be NO file owner/groups whatever so that anyone can edit the share. When I mount it using mount.cifs it shows all the actual file permissions instead of nothing
