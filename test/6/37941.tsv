2010-02-05T02:14:00.000Z	jrib	Darael	best to just ask the channel your actual question (on a single line)
2010-02-05T02:18:00.000Z	jrib	Darael	at least a year ago, it was really buggy.  I always ended up just using cadaver
2010-02-05T02:18:00.000Z	Darael	jrib	Never heard of it - sounds like an interesting fourth thing to try, thanks.
2011-03-01T23:05:00.000Z	jrib	Darael	works ok here on flash player square
2012-04-30T18:45:00.000Z	Darael	jrib	So it does.  Well caught.
