2009-01-30T18:18:00.000Z	stryd_one		i hope someone can help, i need to change file type associations in bulk. i don't want to do right-click/properties/etc for every type (there are a lot).... is there a file or better yet a GUI for editing these?
2009-01-30T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	stryd_one	~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list

2009-01-30T18:22:00.000Z	stryd_one	jrib	I have a mimeapps.list which has a few entries, but not most of them
2009-01-30T18:24:00.000Z	jrib	stryd_one	hmm.  You'll have to experiment, I'm not sure
2009-01-30T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	stryd_one	not offhand, no.  You could write something using inotify I guess
