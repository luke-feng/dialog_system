2012-01-30T17:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	Saiyans007	 every irc network could have its own #judy
2012-01-30T17:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	Saiyans007	 totally wrong.. #channelname
2012-01-30T17:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	Saiyans007	 a server is like 'irc.dal.net' or similer
2012-01-30T17:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	Saiyans007	 most irc clients include lists
2012-01-30T17:32:00.000Z	dr_willis	Saiyans007	 /server servername    and the dalnet homepage has a list of servers
