2007-05-12T16:56:00.000Z	ubuntuuser1988		just added     "beryl-manager" command to the System > Sessions
2007-05-12T16:56:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntuuser1988	you can try "sudo apt-get remove --purge beryl" and then "rm -r /home/user/.beryl*"
2007-05-12T16:59:00.000Z	Jowi	ubuntuuser1988	either use apt-get or synaptic. different tools to achieve the same thing.
