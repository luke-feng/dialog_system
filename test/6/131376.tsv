2009-09-03T23:19:00.000Z	test_		can anyone explain to me why i cannot get pidgin to iconify in stalonetray, is there a setting that i may have over looked (other prog iconify like xchat and gufw)?
2009-09-03T23:19:00.000Z	mgedmin	test_	there is a setting
2009-09-03T23:19:00.000Z	test_	mgedmin	and that would be?
2009-09-03T23:20:00.000Z	mgedmin	test_	if I remembered, I'd tell you, but since I don't, I'd have to open the pidgin preferences window and go through all the tabs
2009-09-03T23:20:00.000Z	mgedmin	test_	I just remember that there _is_ a setting, since I'd toggled it not more than a few months ago
2009-09-03T23:21:00.000Z	test_	mgedmin	so it is thank you ;)
