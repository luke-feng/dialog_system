2011-06-07T16:28:00.000Z	stianhj	dpecka_	what do you mean? what has one thing got to do with the other?
2011-06-07T16:30:00.000Z	dpecka_	stianhj	that's bit of unproportional ... i don't use google much but now i'm unable to send an email with attached 65MB in one file and i just didn't expect that if google still claims with proud how much space we all have that's dumb like this
2011-06-07T16:39:00.000Z	stianhj	dpecka_	the point of all the space is that you never have to delete anything.. it's not your personal filestorage.. just use dropbox or something
