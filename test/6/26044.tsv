2010-05-20T01:04:00.000Z	reenignEesreveR	brontosaurusrex	what client would i use with squid?
2010-05-20T01:05:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	reenignEesreveR	browser, ftp and some i imagine
2010-05-20T01:06:00.000Z	reenignEesreveR	brontosaurusrex	if i put squid as my proxy server in my browser, then all the sites will be browsed via the proxy... i just want one site to pass through proxy
2010-05-20T01:07:00.000Z	brontosaurusrex	reenignEesreveR	no idea, i would install a second browser just for that if there would be no decent settings for that
2010-05-20T01:08:00.000Z	reenignEesreveR	brontosaurusrex	actually i have a few scripts as well ... they'll also need to be recoded ... i wanna make it as transparent as possible
