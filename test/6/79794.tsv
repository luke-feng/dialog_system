2008-01-18T14:40:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	gaurish	lol .. I am known to break installs .. heheehh .. I used to be the re-install king ..
2008-01-18T14:40:00.000Z	gaurish	NineTeen67Comet	i have a term for you "Windows weenies" :p
2008-01-18T14:41:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	gaurish	I don't have an MS box in my house .. When I was new I didn't know how to fix stuff via chroot .. so I just did re-installs .. now, I'm usually only re-installing when I blow up my hard drive or something ..
2008-01-18T14:43:00.000Z	gaurish	NineTeen67Comet	re-installing does not help, as you don't know what the problem was & if by chance next time it comes, then again you have to install again, and you will fall in endless loop.
2008-01-18T14:44:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	gaurish	exactly .. When I teach classes with Linux in them I usually can save what ever the students do now .. The usuall is a broken xorg.conf or malformed fstab . but usually its not a big problem ..
