2006-01-22T10:57:00.000Z	phiber_optic		yeah i hate that u cannot search
2006-01-22T10:57:00.000Z	phiber_optic		and u dont have a library
2006-01-22T10:57:00.000Z	deicidus	phiber_optic	well im not sure but affaik rhythmbox has a simple gtk interface, a library, and is like itunes. xmms is more graphical and is like winamp.
2006-01-22T11:00:00.000Z	deicidus	phiber_optic	i would try both for a few minutes each and see which you like. im probably going to use rhythmbox but im not sure yet.
