2007-06-22T07:47:00.000Z	bruenig	daquino	make install it in to a destdir (make install DESTDIR=/path/to/some/empty/directory) and then add a debian directory in there and create a control file (see apt-cache show firefox or any other application for what that looks like) then use dpkg -b to build it
