2005-11-28T13:26:00.000Z	Latone		can I do apt-get from the terminal window?
2005-11-28T13:27:00.000Z	Latone		I am teaching myself to run a linux webserver ... how would I apt-get apache?
2005-11-28T13:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	Latone	see the URLs above, esp. the first one ^^^
2005-11-28T13:29:00.000Z	Madpilot	Latone	you can also install stuff thru Synaptic, if you don't want to mess around in terminals...
2005-11-28T13:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	Latone	apache2 is in main, so you're OK - I think all the packages you'll need are, actually
