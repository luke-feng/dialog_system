2006-03-17T11:51:00.000Z	rukuartic	fade_	Can you see/access the file? Or are you trying to write to it?
2006-03-17T11:51:00.000Z	rukuartic	fade_	If its an ntfs file system, you can't write to it.
2006-03-17T11:51:00.000Z	fade_	rukuartic	i know, i just try to set normal access
2006-03-17T12:01:00.000Z	rukuartic	fade_	are you in /dev or /mnt or /media?
