2007-05-24T09:57:00.000Z	zero	leagris	i use programs like netbeans/eclipse
2007-05-24T09:57:00.000Z	zero	leagris	i don't really need a big swap partition, do i?
2007-05-24T09:58:00.000Z	leagris	zero	not realy, but enough ram because eclipse havealy use JVM and some quite big ammount of RAM. Having enough ram prevent use of swap slow memory.
2007-05-24T09:59:00.000Z	zero	leagris	i have 1gb ram, maybe with 2 gb it could work great
