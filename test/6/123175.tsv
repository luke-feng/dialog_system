2009-01-16T23:41:00.000Z	neosuki		Hey guys, I'm trying to rip an audio cd using lame in command line mode
2009-01-16T23:42:00.000Z	neosuki		but though i can see in nautilus browser the audio cd content, how can I ls the files in the terminal?
2009-01-16T23:43:00.000Z	neosuki		wot could be the right path for an audio cd if i want to browse from the terminal/cmd line?

2009-01-16T23:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	neosuki	that's because audio cd's are really files. rip them first if you want to see them. or look at them via rhythmbox
