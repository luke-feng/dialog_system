2009-10-03T22:54:00.000Z	Exodus		which one do you have specifically?
2009-10-03T22:56:00.000Z	mnaines	Exodus	if the wireless card can output 20dBm, what antenna would I need for optimal performance?
2009-10-03T22:57:00.000Z	Exodus	mnaines	it really depends on how far you're trying to link up.
2009-10-03T22:57:00.000Z	mnaines	Exodus	Its not the distance...Its that I have to connect through walls with a lot of RFI
2009-10-03T22:58:00.000Z	mnaines	Exodus	There is a lot of harmonic resonance between my computer and the wireless router
2009-10-03T23:00:00.000Z	Exodus	mnaines	then it depends also on the amount of walls and what they're made of :P
