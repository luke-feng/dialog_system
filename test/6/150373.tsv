2005-04-21T11:38:00.000Z	Tomcat_	memnips	Trouble like jerky playback?
2005-04-21T11:38:00.000Z	memnips	Tomcat_	yeah.  little jerky, sound is out of sync, etc.
2005-04-21T11:39:00.000Z	Tomcat_	memnips	My DVD playback was a little jerky, but it's perfect now... the only thing I remember is rebooting. Nothing else.
2005-04-21T11:39:00.000Z	memnips		im playing this from my hd, but, how do i do that too?  =)
2005-04-21T11:39:00.000Z	Tomcat_	memnips	But yeah, DMA might help.
