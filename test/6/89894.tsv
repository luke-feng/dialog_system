2008-11-15T09:54:00.000Z	deuceswild		It just suddenly turns off.
2008-11-15T09:54:00.000Z	deuceswild		Like you pulled out the battery or  whatever.
2008-11-15T09:54:00.000Z	deuceswild		And it has never happened using XP
2008-11-15T09:55:00.000Z	deuceswild		is there a switch i can try?
2008-11-15T09:56:00.000Z	warriorforgod	deuceswild	I would try booting grub with the noapic and acpi=off parameters.
