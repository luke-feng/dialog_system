2006-12-29T12:24:00.000Z	mnoir	psynaps3	prolly ext3
2006-12-29T12:25:00.000Z	mnoir	psynaps3	you want to trade more limited support for a little performance?
2006-12-29T12:29:00.000Z	mnoir	psynaps3	why a boot?
2006-12-29T12:40:00.000Z	mnoir	psynaps3	just make sure to tune2fs them to do fsck more often
