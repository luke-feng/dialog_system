2012-06-07T00:20:00.000Z	ferris		i need some help... not sure which direction I should go... I upgraded the from 10.10 to 11.04 then directly to 12.04... unfortunately I did not reboot between upgrades... DOH!... now I cannot get beyond "checking battery state" at boot... I have a 10.10 disc how can I either get back to 10.10 or get 12.04 to complete the installation? Also, I do not want to loose any of my settings... if possible.

2012-06-07T00:22:00.000Z	alankila	ferris	you can try 'break=mount' kernel option via grub and then chroot /root /bin/bash to see if you get a root shell to try to fix things...
2012-06-07T00:22:00.000Z	alankila	ferris	maybe you have some unconfigured packages, commands like 'apt-get -f install' and 'dpkg --configure -a' could be important
2012-06-07T00:23:00.000Z	alankila	ferris	also the classic 'mount / -o remount,rw' if it says that your filesystem is mounted read-only
2012-06-07T00:24:00.000Z	ferris	alankila	thanks I will try some of those suggestions
