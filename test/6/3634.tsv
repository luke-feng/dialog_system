2012-10-22T04:39:00.000Z	L3top	vulcanmummiex	I think PatrickDickey does not understand that you cannot boot windows... no that cannot be done from the live disk... we are just using the live disk to rule out a bad drive
2012-10-22T04:40:00.000Z	L3top	vulcanmummiex	you are going to probably have to boot into a windows disk and fixmbr/fixboot from the recovery console ONCE a bad drive is ruled out.
