2009-01-18T02:26:00.000Z	shear	nickrud	although i might try a few other mirrors. do you have a list?
2009-01-18T02:27:00.000Z	nickrud	shear	on the dropdown in software sources, I've found the kernel.org to never be slow
2009-01-18T02:31:00.000Z	shear	nickrud	awesome, kernel.org is working fine. for some reason all the canadian mirrors i tried were slow.
