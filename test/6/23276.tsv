2010-03-17T20:35:00.000Z	theadmin	CalmvsKhaos	Might be just my comp though, dunno
2010-03-17T20:36:00.000Z	CalmvsKhaos	theadmin	yeah those keys dont do anything on my box, (IF IT was Windows, it would be the Rewind and Play buttons on my HP keyboard for FN + F5/F6) But thanks anyways :)

2010-03-17T20:43:00.000Z	CalmvsKhaos	theadmin	they're slow when restoring
