2011-04-24T22:44:00.000Z	Ivan96485	tsimpson	Why seti?
2011-04-24T22:45:00.000Z	tsimpson	Ivan96485	sorry, not that package, just bonic and use the GUI to add the folding app
2011-04-24T22:58:00.000Z	Ivan96485	tsimpson	Folding@home is not listed on the BOINC manager.
2011-04-24T22:58:00.000Z	tsimpson	Ivan96485	it should show the instructions on the folding@home web page
