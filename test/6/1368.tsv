2012-09-03T23:53:00.000Z	puppy_parade	MonkeyDust	there is no built in or at least a tool in the repository to tweak the main search?
2012-09-03T23:53:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	puppy_parade	 i don't like/use unity, only knew that link
2012-09-03T23:54:00.000Z	puppy_parade		and none of those seem to touch the search
2012-09-03T23:54:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	puppy_parade	 submit it as an idea in !brainstorm
