2009-09-11T03:05:00.000Z	coilette	d_b	says the address is in use, but i have no other FTP servers running
2009-09-11T03:05:00.000Z	d_b	coilette	if what you want to share is in one folder and you want security I recommend sftp, if not I can't help you as I never got an ftp server running. Took the easy (for me anyway) way out and set up sftp instead :)
