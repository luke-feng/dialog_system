2006-08-07T05:23:00.000Z	bnD	fistandantilus	awesome, thank you, do you know if it presents options that were available from previous install cd?
2006-08-07T05:24:00.000Z	fistandantilus	bnD	couldnt say havent used it personally, the dl links are on ubuntu's download site, there may be more information there
