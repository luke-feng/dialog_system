2007-06-20T05:45:00.000Z	jdstrand	kdub432	apt-get install nvidia-glx
2007-06-20T05:47:00.000Z	jdstrand	kdub432	you'll need the linux-restricted-modules too
2007-06-20T05:47:00.000Z	jdstrand	kdub432	eg apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-386
2007-06-20T05:49:00.000Z	kdub432	jdstrand	i followed the how to on ubuntuforums. i think theres some weird remnants leftover from my ATI card....
