2004-12-07T08:36:00.000Z	hawk16		is it possible to install video card drivers on the live cd?
2004-12-07T08:36:00.000Z	lamont	hawk16	it should be possible...
2004-12-07T08:36:00.000Z	lamont	hawk16	however, note that apt's http method is broken on the live CD
2004-12-07T08:37:00.000Z	lamont	hawk16	and /etc/apt/sources.list is completely useless
2004-12-07T08:37:00.000Z	lamont	hawk16	that is, what's in it is kinda useless.
