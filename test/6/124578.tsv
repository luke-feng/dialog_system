2006-02-27T16:31:00.000Z	TTilus	hackel_	there are evil *implementations*
2006-02-27T16:32:00.000Z	TTilus	hackel_	h323 is not evil itself
2006-02-27T16:32:00.000Z	TTilus	hackel_	gnomemeeting is non-evil implementation  :)
2006-02-27T16:32:00.000Z	hackel_	TTilus	 perhaps not, I just remember many frustrated attempts at using gnomemeeting and how amazing skype quality was when I tried it. :-P
2006-02-27T16:33:00.000Z	TTilus	hackel_	h323 is just plain ancient and does not work very well in net as of today
2006-02-27T16:33:00.000Z	hackel_	TTilus	 Yeah that's why I suggested SIP at first, which gnomemeeting switched to as well.
