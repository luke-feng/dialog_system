2011-08-15T21:07:00.000Z	Dexo	IdleOne	but i dont want desktop lagging the server. it uses resources
2011-08-15T21:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	Dexo	you can only boot one instance of Ubuntu at a time. Yes, you could install both server and Desktop on different partitions but you would only be able to boot to one of those and use it.
