2007-06-23T16:46:00.000Z	jart		so now i can't like control my media player with windows key + b and stuff
2007-06-23T16:46:00.000Z	jart		:(
2007-06-23T16:47:00.000Z	jart		i've looked all over google and found only questions, no answers.  i also tried grepping through the gnome configurations to find where keyboard settings are stored but to no avail
