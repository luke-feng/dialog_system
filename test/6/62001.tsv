2008-03-13T12:29:00.000Z	souper	d4rkmonkey	dvd's essentially are data cds
2008-03-13T12:29:00.000Z	souper		try pointing your player to where its mounted
2008-03-13T12:31:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	souper	tried that, doesn't work.
2008-03-13T12:32:00.000Z	souper		will your player play dvd movies that you physically put in a drive?
2008-03-13T12:32:00.000Z	d4rkmonkey	souper	yup. I'll try what Jaapjan-Work sent
