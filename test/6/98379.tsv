2008-05-26T05:56:00.000Z	james__		I have a lot of pulse audio issues
2008-05-26T05:56:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	james__	i don't think you're the only one.
2008-05-26T05:56:00.000Z	james__		talk about the blind leading the blind
2008-05-26T05:56:00.000Z	james__	IndyGunFreak	how so?
2008-05-26T05:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		because i've saw a lot of problems relating to pulseaudio here.
2008-05-26T05:58:00.000Z	james__	IndyGunFreak	ya but my sound seems to inherently work, why does it show so many errors? and am I really using pulse audio or alsa sound server?
