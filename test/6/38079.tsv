2009-04-29T22:49:00.000Z	hisa		it depends on your hardware ... I have a nvidia graphics card and I had to enable propietary driver to get it working correctly at full resolution, and be able to use compiz
2009-04-29T22:50:00.000Z	grifter188	hisa	on the install of your 9.04 did it say your card was not supported, then you installed the driver after it was installed???  by any chance?
