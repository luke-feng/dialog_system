2005-02-03T15:41:00.000Z	crimsun	parazoid	err...download more than 2 files, I suppose :)
2005-02-03T15:42:00.000Z	crimsun	parazoid	why, is something broken?
2005-02-03T15:42:00.000Z	parazoid	crimsun	I don?t know. I just cannot download more than two files at a time
2005-02-03T15:44:00.000Z	crimsun	parazoid	I don't see any option in mozilla-firefox to limit concurrent downloads to 2
2005-02-03T15:44:00.000Z	parazoid	crimsun	hmm..
