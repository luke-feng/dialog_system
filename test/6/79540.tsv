2008-06-06T04:11:00.000Z	BobCFC	akahige	the next version of gnome 2.24 is supposed to fix that
2008-06-06T04:32:00.000Z	BobCFC	akahige	take a screenshot of you desktop then cut and paste two wallpapers together on top in GIMP
2008-06-06T04:32:00.000Z	BobCFC	akahige	you can find screenshot in Applications ->accessories
2008-06-06T04:34:00.000Z	BobCFC	akahige	then you will have base for image that is correct size
2008-06-06T04:34:00.000Z	BobCFC	akahige	use it like a template
