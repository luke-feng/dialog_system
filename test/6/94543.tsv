2007-05-05T09:49:00.000Z	cables	DBO	they're NOT in ~/.Trash, that's what I just said.
2007-05-05T09:50:00.000Z	DBO	cables	alright technically yes its a combination of several folders, but most anything you delete will be in ~/.Trash
2007-05-05T09:51:00.000Z	cables	DBO	yes, I realize that. That's why I specified that there was NOT any trash in any .Trash folder
2007-05-05T09:51:00.000Z	DBO	cables	my mistake, I see where the confusion is now, moooooving on =)
2007-05-05T09:51:00.000Z	cables	DBO	sorry for being rude, I'm a bit annoyed :(
