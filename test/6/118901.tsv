2007-01-14T15:26:00.000Z	Ayabara		I'm gonna run xp/ubuntu dual boot, and I'm wondering if I should use ext3 or fat32 for my shared partition. I'm aware that ext3 is better, but I want it to work as good as possible with both os'es. With the ext3 fs-driver for windows I think I've had trouble with nordic letters in filenames earlier. Any advice guys?
