2010-01-20T03:32:00.000Z	maritz		Hi. I've attached a usb2.0 stick (8gb kingston) to my pc and it is incredibly slow when transferring large files. (according to a few ls checks it's at below 1mb/s now)
2010-01-20T03:32:00.000Z	maritz		I've googled around and there seem to be a tonne of other users with such problems. However they mostly have ~4mb/s, which is a bit more than I'm seeing. And all the "solutions" I found, didn't help so far. Any ideas?
2010-01-20T03:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maritz	 ive noticed that also. not really looked into a fix.
2010-01-20T03:34:00.000Z	maritz	Dr_Willis	I'm trying to copy ~4GB to the stick... at the current rate and apparent decline of speed, it's gonna finish... never. :(
2010-01-20T03:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maritz	 yep - ive noticed it being very slow.
2010-01-20T03:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	maritz	 also aseems to depend on which of my USB ports i use. I got some exctra usb add on cards.
