2009-09-18T07:31:00.000Z	alokito	AutoMatriX	yes if u have a separate partition for /home
2009-09-18T07:33:00.000Z	alokito	AutoMatriX	and if u don't have a separate partition then you can simply link everything in the home directory to the other distro's home directory
2009-09-18T07:33:00.000Z	AutoMatriX	alokito	euh, I'm trying to understand ...
