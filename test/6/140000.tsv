2005-12-20T09:53:00.000Z	SanderD		How dangerous is it to try out Dapper? Do I help the developers if I do that (and report bugs etc.)?
2005-12-20T09:54:00.000Z	nox_ghost	SanderD	yeah, you can help the developers by reporting bugs. You can encouter problems that in order fix them you have to rewrite part of the code and recompile it to get it work.
2005-12-20T09:55:00.000Z	SanderD	nox_ghost	and if I can't really write code?
2005-12-20T09:55:00.000Z	nox_ghost	SanderD	So you will be stuck with a system that can't boot, for example.
2005-12-20T09:56:00.000Z	SanderD	nox_ghost	okay, but then I could always reinstall ubuntu...
2005-12-20T09:56:00.000Z	nox_ghost	SanderD	If you have the time and patience, do it.
