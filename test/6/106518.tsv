2007-02-04T17:28:00.000Z	xaos		i'm using dapper, and i broke my software index. when i run apt-get install -f , it tells me i have to remove 821 mb worth of packages. is there a way to remove the packages i installed (edgy libc6 libs, and others) without removing my entire system? or should i let it remove all teh files and run update manager to upgrade to edgy?
2007-02-04T17:29:00.000Z	xaos		ok
2007-02-04T17:30:00.000Z	xaos		i have amd64 so i want wireless function, edgys 64 kernel didnt work with wireless
2007-02-04T17:31:00.000Z	xaos		in order to upgrade i have to uninstall that 800mb packages first...
2007-02-04T17:31:00.000Z	xaos		i should be able to copy the list, and reinstall them later right?
