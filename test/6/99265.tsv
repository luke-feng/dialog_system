2006-12-22T15:32:00.000Z	SkullBr00d		Hello?
2006-12-22T15:32:00.000Z	SkullBr00d		I have a small problem here...
2006-12-22T15:33:00.000Z	SkullBr00d		I have Windows XP on my computer, but it's using all my hard drive (when I installed it it didn't ask me for partition sizes :S) and now I want to put Ubuntu on it.
2006-12-22T15:34:00.000Z	SkullBr00d		Do you know any way of doing it through Windows partition manager? (I once tried Partition Magic and I just got my Partition blow up...  it was really magic LOL
