2011-01-10T19:10:00.000Z	BPCadmin		rusty149; i made the directory and double checked that it was there by browsing to it
2011-01-10T19:11:00.000Z	rusty149	BPCadmin	Capital D in Downloads
2011-01-10T19:09:00.000Z	rusty149	BPCadmin	fog-setup probably doesn't exist.  sudo mkdir /opt/fog-setup
2011-01-10T19:11:00.000Z	rusty149	BPCadmin	use Downloads not downloads
