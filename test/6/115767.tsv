2007-09-09T08:56:00.000Z	stefg	ariane	why dont you just boot up the Desktop -CD, look at hda1 if there's still something on it, and in case there is, unmout it and run a fsck on that drive?

2007-09-09T09:36:00.000Z	stefg	ariane	this drive is apparently toast.... if you discover you're riding a dead horse, unmount
