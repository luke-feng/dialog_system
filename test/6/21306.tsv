I would disconnect the data cable (dont bother to remove power, since you will be connecting the drive again). I doubt, that disabling the internal drive will help, usually that is not neccessary. Perhaps you bios cant boot from USB
2010-05-06T02:59:00.000Z	radhika	hmw	When I was running windows earlier, I had disabled the drive through device manager and then the bios recognized my usb dvd drive as bootable cd/dvd/.. if I don't disable it it recognizes my internal one which does not work, there is no option in the bios to disable it
