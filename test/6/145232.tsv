2009-11-18T00:07:00.000Z	Dougal		does anyone know of a cross-platform protocol that'll send webcam during an IM session? I want to view on a linux box my friend's webcam, he runs windows. (And usually chats through yahoo, although i'm sure he'd consider switching). Anyone know a service that could help?
