2007-01-31T08:06:00.000Z	Jowi	rausb0	no it isn't. a is archive and r is recursive. two different things
2007-01-31T08:06:00.000Z	rausb0	Jowi	-a implies -r
2007-01-31T08:07:00.000Z	rausb0	Jowi	-a copies recursively and preserves ownerships and permissions (and even device files)
2007-01-31T08:08:00.000Z	Jowi	rausb0	yes, but a will preserve links. normally I do not want that (only want the actual files). it's a matter of taste i think :)
2007-01-31T08:11:00.000Z	rausb0	Jowi	alright
