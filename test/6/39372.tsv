2011-04-12T12:16:00.000Z	thedark_		Hello everyone. Everytime I try to export a file in Audacity, it hangs. I am using version 1.3.6 on Ubuntu 10-10
2011-04-12T12:17:00.000Z	shcherbak	thedark_	Did you try to test it with tine size project (few secondsof flat record), and any hint in logs?
2011-04-12T12:20:00.000Z	shcherbak	thedark_	Do you have it properly configured, cards and alsa?
2011-04-12T12:20:00.000Z	shcherbak	thedark_	Do it record and play?
2011-04-12T12:24:00.000Z	shcherbak	thedark_	It do not log (or at least I unaware of it), check messages, etc, if it is hardware connected it will be there.
2011-04-12T12:29:00.000Z	shcherbak	thedark_	Bug was reported already, maybe there is a fix. or try with jack (not sure that there is any recent how to)
