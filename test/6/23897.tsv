2010-03-10T11:21:00.000Z	brjann	Kasm279	bettsp: i would recommend the ntfs-3g option, as the in-kernel ntfs module is old and nigh-unsupported at this point
2010-03-10T11:24:00.000Z	brjann	Kasm279	screen would be the best way
2010-03-10T11:24:00.000Z	Kasm279	brjann	right now kwin is down
2010-03-10T11:25:00.000Z	brjann	Kasm279	i have no idea what kwin is :)
2010-03-10T11:25:00.000Z	Kasm279	brjann	whatever the window manager in GNOME is
