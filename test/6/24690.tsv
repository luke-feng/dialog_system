2011-12-11T20:57:00.000Z	jutnux		LXDE resembles windows.
2011-12-11T20:57:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	jutnux	no, but it is retrievable I assume?
2011-12-11T20:59:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	jutnux	I have more than one pc so making a disk is easy, I just don't have any extra hard drives so I have to resize one of my 1.5TB drives to make room for the new install
2011-12-11T21:01:00.000Z	Dj_FlyBy	jutnux	no point in trying to repair it. The hard drive has 68 bad sectors on it that appeared overnight
