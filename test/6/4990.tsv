2012-04-26T22:01:00.000Z	BadCodSmell		When installing ubuntu in expert mode, how do I partition? As in something like cfdisk? IT wont let me do anything to the partitions that it auto generates or that are already there

2012-04-26T22:03:00.000Z	BadCodSmell	nitzs	I don't have thoise options, I just have weirdness such as guided partition that insists on using all of the space
2012-04-26T22:04:00.000Z	BadCodSmell		ah dont worry I figured it out, the interface just isnt very intuitive compared to traditional tools such as windows fdisk
