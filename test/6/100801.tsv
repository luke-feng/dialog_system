2010-03-22T23:00:00.000Z	andrevanzuydam		Ok - but when i need to run a whole group of commands - ie compiling etc - its a pain to do sudo each time, what is the difference ?
2010-03-22T23:00:00.000Z	andrevanzuydam		I would like to understand this properly
2010-03-22T23:01:00.000Z	andrevanzuydam		Ok - I may be wrong but in my experience doing a make / make install without sudo doesn't normally work
