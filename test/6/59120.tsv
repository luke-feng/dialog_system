2008-04-30T13:29:00.000Z	fde	Kennie`	You can wait a bit to get any late fixes and some security updates... still have a year on dapper I think
2008-04-30T13:30:00.000Z	Kennie`	fde	: yes, but then it means i'm in the same situation next year? ;)
2008-04-30T13:30:00.000Z	fde	Kennie`	No, because they'll fix most of the issues with upgrading by then, and it'll be mostly seamless  :)
2008-04-30T13:30:00.000Z	fde	Kennie`	Besides, I'm not really saying a year, just a few months or so...
2008-04-30T13:31:00.000Z	Kennie`	fde	: ok, that makes sense :) - thanks
