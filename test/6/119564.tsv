2006-06-04T08:39:00.000Z	ulisse		hello
2006-06-04T08:41:00.000Z	ulisse		why do i haven't the "upgrade to dapper" button on update-manager on breezy?
2006-06-04T08:41:00.000Z	julien_c	ulisse	because dapper drake (ubuntu 6.06) is out, and you can upgrade instead of reinstalling everything
2006-06-04T08:43:00.000Z	ulisse	julien_c	yes, but on the net I've seen that there should be a new button on the update-manager, but it doesn't appear...
2006-06-04T08:43:00.000Z	ulisse	julien_c	I know how to upgrade in other ways, but I'd like to try this new one
2006-06-04T08:43:00.000Z	julien_c	ulisse	oh sorry i misread
