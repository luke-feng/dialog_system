2012-11-16T22:51:00.000Z	RJ45		jrib:, I hate all Ubuntu versions before and after 10.04, I have only ever felt 'at home' with 10.04.
2012-11-16T22:52:00.000Z	RJ45		10.04 sucks so bad, BUT, the 10.04.4 has A LOT of bug fixes, and it's beautiful!
2012-11-16T22:53:00.000Z	RJ45		I'm not going anywhere away from 10.04 EVER, it's like Windows users who see Vista and wanna stay with XP, there are reasons.
2012-11-16T22:54:00.000Z	RJ45		I'm gonna try installing Audacity 12.04 on 10.04, wish me luck, any sujestions that might help if it's becomes un-rebootable?
2012-11-16T22:55:00.000Z	sargennto	RJ45	what are your reasons for never upgrading?
2012-11-16T22:56:00.000Z	RJ45	sargennto	same reasons why Windows users didn't wanna upgrade from XP to Vista; EVERYTHING!
