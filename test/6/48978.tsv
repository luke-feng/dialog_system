2008-12-30T15:13:00.000Z	DefamedPrawn		can anybody help me in this chan? Firefox won't start.
2008-12-30T15:14:00.000Z	GibbaTheHutt	DefamedPrawn	try running it from a console and see if any error
2008-12-30T15:15:00.000Z	DefamedPrawn	GibbaTheHutt	nope. No error. Nothing.
2008-12-30T15:16:00.000Z	DefamedPrawn	GibbaTheHutt	yes, the process exists ... it's just not doing anything.
2008-12-30T15:18:00.000Z	GibbaTheHutt	DefamedPrawn	if its an old instance, you could try killing it and restarting it
2008-12-30T15:19:00.000Z	DefamedPrawn	GibbaTheHutt	ok done that. Have now restarted firefox from the console and am waiting for something to happen..
