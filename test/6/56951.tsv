2008-05-28T11:43:00.000Z	new2linux_		do you have to create 10 users for 10 thin-clients or just enough with 1 users accounts for 10 thin-clients?
2008-05-28T11:44:00.000Z	m11	new2linux_	1 user per thin i think
2008-05-28T11:44:00.000Z	m11	new2linux_	would be mess if all users would have same acount and use same files :)
2008-05-28T11:45:00.000Z	new2linux_	m11	sluxor, thanks for the advise
2008-05-28T11:45:00.000Z	m11	new2linux_	u can check edubuntu setup for thin clients
2008-05-28T11:47:00.000Z	new2linux_	m11	i'll try reading the walkthrough later, now the firefox freeze because of the adobe flash plugin installation :(
