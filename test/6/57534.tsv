2011-06-19T22:04:00.000Z	domino14		i think i just ruined my ubuntu. it told me that dpkg was interrupted, i must run sudo dpkg —configure -a
2011-06-19T22:05:00.000Z	domino14		and i tried that and it tells me dpkg: error: parsing file '/var/lib/dpkg/status' near line 0: EOF after field name `'
2011-06-19T22:05:00.000Z	usr13	domino14	dpkg --configure -a shouldn't ruin it.
2011-06-19T22:06:00.000Z	domino14	usr13	when i ran dpkg —configure -a i got that parsing error
