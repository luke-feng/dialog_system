2011-11-11T03:20:00.000Z	Jonii		Hey, is there any point in pressing ctrl+alt+f1?
2011-11-11T03:21:00.000Z	Jonii		You get to text-terminal that way. I'm kinda wondering if there are reasons to try to use your computer that way
2011-11-11T03:21:00.000Z	Jonii		The idea seems pretty neat
2011-11-11T03:22:00.000Z	Jonii		Anyone? Can anyone point me to a tutorial that explains the point behind text-terminals in this day of guis?
2011-11-11T03:24:00.000Z	jost__	Jonii	What about administrating remote machines (Which may have no Desktop installed)? Efficience in achieving some goal? Lack of good GUI?
2011-11-11T03:27:00.000Z	jost__	Jonii	automating things is another reason for using command lines. This is also true in Windows and other operation systems.
