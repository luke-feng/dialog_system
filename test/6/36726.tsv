2010-03-24T19:39:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	akshay	«jobs» will show you any jobs you suspended with ^Z
2010-03-24T19:40:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	akshay	if that's the only one listed, you can resume it with «fg»
2010-03-24T19:41:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	akshay	are you running it from the same terminal you started the apt job on?
