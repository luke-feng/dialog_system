2011-07-12T02:54:00.000Z	Ingsoc	qin	Thanks mate!
2011-07-12T02:54:00.000Z	qin	Ingsoc	Also dpkg-reconfigure locales is usefull for servers
2011-07-12T02:54:00.000Z	qin	Ingsoc	as locale command
2011-07-12T02:55:00.000Z	Ingsoc	qin	I think iconv was what I wa trying to remember. I am just trying to edit one config file on for a minecraft server. Thanks again for the tips!
