2007-10-05T16:58:00.000Z	edd		can someone help me with ultimate ubuntu's desktop effects...for some reason I keep getting the "The Composite Extension is not available" message
2007-10-05T05:06:00.000Z	edd		what is automatix exactly....im going through everything and removing what I don't want....do you know a distro of ubuntu that has the cool cube effects and basically just wine, and firefox preinstalled
2007-10-05T05:07:00.000Z	edd		oh so basically its extremely experimental software that can greatly damage your OS
2007-10-05T05:08:00.000Z	edd		the only thing im worried about is the wireless drivers...all i did in UU was download the .deb file through the forums and isntall it through the flash drive
2007-10-05T05:09:00.000Z	edd		another thing im confused about is...in the current official version of ubuntu...do the hdd, cdrom, and usb mount automatically? bc i am still somewhat green with linux and often forget the commands
