2010-08-05T13:19:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Tohuw	ok thank you.
2010-08-05T13:26:00.000Z	Tohuw	Benkinooby	if you're aiming for a very lean system, and understand just what you want, the minimal install is perfect, I've found
2010-08-05T13:28:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Tohuw	PythonPup : thank you. thought the alternate cd would also give me choice about the packages to be "initally" installed.
2010-08-05T13:29:00.000Z	Tohuw	Benkinooby	PythonPup: It's a shame though, because ubuntu-server does give you those options; the alt cd really should too
2010-08-05T13:30:00.000Z	Benkinooby	Tohuw	+1 ;)
