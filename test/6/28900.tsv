2009-11-01T21:52:00.000Z	garymaurizi		My webcam ¨Microsoft Lifecam Show¨ worked incredibly well in Jaunty Jackelope however after updating too Karmic Koala  it is all pixelated and the color is BAD, what caused this? Karmic is forcing my cam too use the v4l uvcvideo driver, should I try using gspca?!? and how can I force my camera too use gspca instead of uvcvideo modeprobe -r uvcvideo && modprobe gspca says that there is NO gspca module!! after i installed gspca following this tutoria

2009-11-01T21:55:00.000Z	furuno	garymaurizi	: then it's better on the forum, since I believe more people can read it (maybe one of us in IRC don't have the same webcam)
