2005-04-26T12:30:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ficusplanet	That is indeed odd.
2005-04-26T12:31:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Tomcat_	Yeah.  They didn't change it at all.
2005-04-26T12:31:00.000Z	Tomcat_	ficusplanet	I was skeptical because when you partition a circle into three parts, of course the sizes will be the same... but they didn't even change the positions... that's really odd.
2005-04-26T12:32:00.000Z	ficusplanet	Tomcat_	Yeah.  I guess some designer at MS got lazy. ;)
