2007-07-11T15:57:00.000Z	Spaceman3750		This thing will leave Windows intact, won't it?
2007-07-11T15:57:00.000Z	Spaceman3750		It says it's going to destroy some data
2007-07-11T15:57:00.000Z	Spaceman3750		Help...
2007-07-11T15:58:00.000Z	Spaceman3750		Guys, the Feisty installation leaves Windows intact, right?
