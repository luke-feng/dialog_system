2011-11-16T20:29:00.000Z	kanhiya		I usually disable my touch pad by double tapping  near a LED provided at the edge & LED start glowing in Windows, in Ubuntu 11.10 touchpad is working but i am not able to disable it by tapping near LED, which software to download for that
2011-11-16T20:29:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	kanhiya	you can disable the doubletap in system settings
2011-11-16T20:31:00.000Z	kanhiya	LogicallyDashing	I am saying to disable touch pad entirely when i tap twice near LED provided on touchpad
2011-11-16T20:32:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	kanhiya	oh, well, it's really just a workaround but there's a panel applet to lock the mouse pointer
2011-11-16T20:33:00.000Z	kanhiya	LogicallyDashing	Tell me about the app & how to add that to taskbar
2011-11-16T20:37:00.000Z	LogicallyDashing	kanhiya	it appears I was remembering something from xfce and not unity or gnome. sorry
