2010-01-08T20:49:00.000Z	arleslie	perlmonkey2	System: Administrator Settings: Services .... I think
2010-01-08T20:50:00.000Z	perlmonkey2	arleslie	that's where i looked for it, but don't see it.  Do you know what it is called so I can install it?

2010-01-08T20:54:00.000Z	perlmonkey2	arleslie	thanks that works, but I'd still like the gnome services management tool.
