2008-10-14T04:52:00.000Z	dudus	chris4585	try chmod -R 644 folder
2008-10-14T04:53:00.000Z	chris4585	dudus	will that do what I want?
2008-10-14T04:53:00.000Z	dudus		yeah but the permissions for files have a different meaning than the permissions for folder
2008-10-14T04:54:00.000Z	dudus		on folders -r mean list the dir contants and -x means user can cd to the dir
2008-10-14T04:55:00.000Z	chris4585	dudus	ok
