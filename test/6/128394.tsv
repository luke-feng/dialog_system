2007-01-04T14:56:00.000Z	liquidengineer		I've got an old laptop (256 MB, 1 GHz original Athlon)
2007-01-04T14:56:00.000Z	liquidengineer		I'd like to put some buntu on it
2007-01-04T14:57:00.000Z	liquidengineer		but I'm not sure which one to use
2007-01-04T14:58:00.000Z	liquidengineer		There's a slight possibility of upgrading the memory to 384 sometime in the future
2007-01-04T14:58:00.000Z	kane77	liquidengineer	I suggest xubuntu, although I ran normal ubuntu just fine on 1Ghz Duron with 256 Ram
