2010-08-31T12:56:00.000Z	CorpusCallosum		hi i have a problem about network-manager i guess, if a command ifconfig -a i can see the wlan0 interface, but it seems disabled. i cannot enabble. ifconfig wlan0 up command gives an "no such file directory" output. i tried to add related lines to network/interface file annd still no succes. any idea ?
