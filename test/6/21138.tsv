2010-06-09T03:45:00.000Z	acerimmer_	jabagawee	what are you trying to accomplish
2010-06-09T03:46:00.000Z	jabagawee		i need to boot into recovery mode, but i can't seem to access grub
2010-06-09T03:46:00.000Z	acerimmer_	jabagawee	during boot hit <esc> and that will usually drop you to the grub prompt
2010-06-09T03:47:00.000Z	jabagawee	acerimmer_	alright, though i was hoping for some people who might have experience with the dell
2010-06-09T03:47:00.000Z	acerimmer_	jabagawee	grub is grub.
