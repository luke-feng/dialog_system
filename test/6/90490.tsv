2007-10-18T17:39:00.000Z	naer_dinsul		Thanks Ali_ix...  Man, the mirrors are getting hammered...
2007-10-18T17:40:00.000Z	Ali_ix	naer_dinsul	yes! all servers are under fire :D it is an alternative mirror list i found :)
2007-10-18T17:40:00.000Z	naer_dinsul	Ali_ix	Well, I suppose it's a credit to the ferocity of the Ubuntu crowd...
2007-10-18T17:52:00.000Z	naer_dinsul	Ali_ix	 I don't know if I'm the only one having problems, but it looks like the torrent tracker is now inundated too...  I can't get a response from the server...
