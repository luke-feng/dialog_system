2011-05-25T22:43:00.000Z	trism	nivardus	~/.dmrc I believe
2011-05-25T22:44:00.000Z	nivardus	trism	no such file in 11.04 at least
2011-05-25T22:44:00.000Z	trism	nivardus	it is here in 11.04 on my system
2011-05-25T22:47:00.000Z	nivardus	trism	it may only be created if a non-unity shell is used, thanks I have figured it out
2011-05-25T22:48:00.000Z	trism	nivardus	yes, I had the same thought, time to experiment
