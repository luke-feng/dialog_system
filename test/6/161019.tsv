2005-07-08T05:23:00.000Z	Michel		How do I run OpenOffice 2?
2005-07-08T05:25:00.000Z	Michel		I installed it from synaptic
2005-07-08T05:25:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Michel	it is in the universe component, as openoffice2
2005-07-08T05:25:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Michel	it should install into the menus
2005-07-08T05:26:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Michel	because the binary for OO.o2 has a 2 in the name
2005-07-08T05:26:00.000Z	Burgundavia	Michel	to allow parallel installs
