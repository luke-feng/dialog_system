2009-07-13T18:18:00.000Z	Xubuntnoob		i made a script to run the steam client in wine,  and it's not doing what i want it to.  it executes the command 'pasuspender wine /home/admin/.wine/drive_c/steam.exe' just fine, but i'd like to redirect the error messages into a log file ie  '&> /home/admin/game.logs/steam.log', but the messages come up in terminal still, what'd i miss?
