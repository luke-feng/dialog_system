2008-07-09T20:10:00.000Z	Shoopuf		This program I'm trying to compile says I need the "libvorbisfile (vorbis-devel rpm package)" package, but i'm looking in the repository and there's a LOT of stuff about vorbisu... which should i download???
2008-07-09T20:11:00.000Z	Slart	Shoopuf	libvorbis-dev might do the trick..
2009-01-06T17:41:00.000Z	Slart	Shoopuf	you can always upgrade..
2009-01-06T17:41:00.000Z	Slart	Shoopuf	but for a server I would almost recommend sticking to the LTS.. life is easier that way =)
2009-01-06T17:45:00.000Z	Shoopuf	Slart	ok guess ill just stick with 8.04 LTS
2009-01-06T17:48:00.000Z	Slart	Shoopuf	you'll get secrurity updates... otherwise things will stay the same.. ie all scripts you wrote will still work, things will be named the same etc.. stability is important for a server
