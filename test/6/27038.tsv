2012-02-25T02:14:00.000Z	adfasdfj		Another thing Ubuntu can't do...
2012-02-25T02:14:00.000Z	adfasdfj		Later guys
2012-02-25T02:14:00.000Z	adfasdfj		I've fought with it for a few hours now
2012-02-25T02:15:00.000Z	adfasdfj		Yes fine
2012-02-25T02:15:00.000Z	ssta	adfasdfj	prints to my psc 1410 just fine...I can't imagine 1210 is all THAT much different
