2008-01-18T23:59:00.000Z	frojnd	uri	problem is I can't remeber the names of codecs :S I have installed all kinds of codecs including windows32

2008-01-19T00:01:00.000Z	frojnd	uri	yes
2008-01-19T00:02:00.000Z	uri	frojnd	ah... I don't know then cuz usually I just stick to the official "unofficial" ones, so i just reinstall them when something goes wrong
