2007-07-15T11:08:00.000Z	Savenger	Anlar	how can i disable it?
2007-07-15T11:08:00.000Z	Anlar	Savenger	preferences -> sound. then use "winecfg" to select alsa as sound device.. and I don't know about UT but perhaps it just auto-detects things
2007-07-15T11:10:00.000Z	Savenger	Anlar	i have already alsa as sound device
