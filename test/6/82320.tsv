2007-08-13T11:05:00.000Z	faileas	Davy_Jones	helix is open source, that means a lot to some people
2007-08-13T11:06:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	faileas	but it doesn't do the job
2007-08-13T11:07:00.000Z	faileas	Davy_Jones	well, just use realplayer then ;p
2007-08-13T11:07:00.000Z	Davy_Jones	faileas	absolutely
2007-08-13T11:09:00.000Z	faileas	Davy_Jones	on the other hand, there're are idealists who believe ALL software needs to free, realists who use whatever suits them, people who go linux cause its free... the beauty of FOSS is that it accomodates the whole spectrum of em ;)
