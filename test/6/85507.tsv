2007-05-31T15:34:00.000Z	Murdock76	mc44	well i have the mplayer installed and also the plugin for firefox.  the audio plays, but not the video.  i downloaded the codec package from their website, but i'm not sure where the codec files themselves belong.
2007-05-31T15:34:00.000Z	mc44	Murdock76	er... mplayer in ubuntu comes with the codecs already... what was the codec package you downloaded?
