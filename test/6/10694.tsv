2012-06-29T02:39:00.000Z	karthee_	ActionParsnip	No I don't use proxy for web accesss. But the system is in our company and I guess there is an internal mirror
2012-06-29T02:39:00.000Z	karthee_	ActionParsnip	not sure how to check it

2012-06-29T02:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	karthee_	if you edit /etc/apt/apt.conf   is the proxy listed there. Also if you you run:  echo $http_proxy; echo $ftp_proxy    does it output anythig?
