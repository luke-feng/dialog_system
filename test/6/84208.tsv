2007-07-11T09:53:00.000Z	Spark		it's ridiculous
2007-07-11T09:53:00.000Z	xTaJMoX	Spark	sda or hda are ide devices
2007-07-11T09:54:00.000Z	Spark	xTaJMoX	sda are there, just not hda
2007-07-11T09:58:00.000Z	Spark	xTaJMoX	i just dist-upgraded that's all
2007-07-11T10:01:00.000Z	Spark	xTaJMoX	so it is the same as update-manager?
