2007-02-17T10:40:00.000Z	findeton		i've got this problem: i'm trying to compile a program called gtkguitune in ubuntu but i can't. When running ./configure it says i need to have installed Qt (>= Qt 3.0.1) (headers and libraries). The funny thing is that I've got installed libqt3-headers version 3.3.3
2007-02-17T10:41:00.000Z	findeton		it says: "checking for Qt... configure: error: Qt (>= Qt 3.0.1) (headers and libraries) not found. Please check your installation!"
2007-02-17T10:41:00.000Z	findeton		uhm
