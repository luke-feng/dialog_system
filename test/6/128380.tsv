2007-04-12T12:16:00.000Z	dwellshere		my cd drive is buggered
2007-04-12T12:17:00.000Z	dwellshere		would it be a matter of copying the install image to the usb drive?
2007-04-12T12:17:00.000Z	dwellshere		on my laptop?

2007-04-12T12:18:00.000Z	kane77	dwellshere	you'd need something that would be able to "burn" the image onto usb disk...
