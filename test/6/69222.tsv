2012-11-25T10:16:00.000Z	Th3Pun15h3r		anyone used bodhi or wattos?
2012-11-25T10:16:00.000Z	Th3Pun15h3r		wondering if either is better than lubuntu for a lightweight 64 bit os
2012-11-25T10:17:00.000Z	[deXter]	Th3Pun15h3r	I've used bodhi and don't think it's lighter than lubuntu, plus E17 is still under heavy development, not suitable for daily usage, if you ask me.
