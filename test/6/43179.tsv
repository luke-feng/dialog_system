2010-05-01T19:29:00.000Z	kutagh		(2010-05-01 16:25:39) kutagh: Okay. Having issues with trying to install Xubuntu 10.04 on my laptop. Inserted the DVD (burned ISO to DVD) and restarted laptop. It then goes on to the language selection menu and the options menu, where I can first pick the language and then choose "Try out Xubuntu without installing", "Install Xubuntu", "Check the disc for errors" and such. At that point, the first two (Try out Xubuntu/Install Xubuntu) just.. hang..
2010-05-01T19:29:00.000Z	kutagh		Any suggestions? (I tried getting help already at the #Xubuntu channel but no response yet).
2010-05-01T19:30:00.000Z	kutagh		Baatti, how did you burn the data? With the built-in DVD burning feature from windows?
2010-05-01T19:31:00.000Z	kutagh		1,5 MB/s ;)
2010-05-01T19:31:00.000Z	baatti	kutagh	Yes
2010-05-01T19:32:00.000Z	baatti	kutagh	so there is no way to recover that information inside of Ubuntu?
