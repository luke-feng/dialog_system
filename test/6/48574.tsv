2009-04-05T03:16:00.000Z	Slart	Aizawa	wouldn't that be the same as only using the main repository?
2009-04-05T03:16:00.000Z	Slart	Aizawa	I'm not sure though
2009-04-05T03:17:00.000Z	Slart	Aizawa	ah.. it does? are you sure?
2009-04-05T03:17:00.000Z	Slart	Aizawa	hmm.. then I don't really know of a way.. perhaps there is a customized version somewhere
2009-04-05T03:18:00.000Z	Aizawa	Slart	As said, and as someone replied, there IS an option to only install free software, I just had trouble finding it. Apparently it's a boot option, I'll check it out.
