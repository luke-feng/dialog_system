2006-03-14T13:53:00.000Z	reinheart	keithhhhhhhhh	: No.  VMWare is a virtual machine and you have to install Windows XP inside it again
2006-03-14T13:53:00.000Z	keithhhhhhhhh	reinheart	- is there anyway to do what I said?
2006-03-14T13:54:00.000Z	reinheart	keithhhhhhhhh	: Depends on how you define "access"
2006-03-14T13:54:00.000Z	reinheart	keithhhhhhhhh	: If you meant accessing the partition and running Windows programs you need Wine
2006-03-14T13:54:00.000Z	keithhhhhhhhh	reinheart	- I meant run windows programs
