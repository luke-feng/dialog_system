2011-09-09T05:41:00.000Z	MissingPerson		I'm having trouble with my install of mint, stuck in live CD, trying to backup the files on my home partition to my portable HD, because whenever i start my mint install, my home folder is inaccessible, and a lot of config files don't work from my fedora install
2011-09-09T05:41:00.000Z	MissingPerson		but whenever i try to, it says permission denied, and trying to set it to open the partition as administrator tells me "cannot do it because we don't know what program to use"
2011-09-09T05:41:00.000Z	MissingPerson		can anyone help?
2011-09-09T05:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	MissingPerson	mint isn't supported in ubuntu
2011-09-09T05:43:00.000Z	MissingPerson	zykotick9	and linuxmint-help doesn't answer any questions
2011-09-09T05:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	MissingPerson	so pick a distribution that can answer your questions!
