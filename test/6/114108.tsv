2008-11-24T00:38:00.000Z	jrib	eLtangaZ	many terminal programs use ctrl-v
2008-11-24T00:38:00.000Z	jrib	eLtangaZ	(for other things)
2008-11-24T00:39:00.000Z	jrib	eLtangaZ	if you don't know about it yet, you can highlight to copy and middle click to paste in X
2008-11-24T00:43:00.000Z	jrib	eLtangaZ	you really shouldn't be pasting that much into a terminal...
2008-11-24T00:44:00.000Z	jrib	eLtangaZ	well I don't see why you need a terminal at all then
