2010-01-04T15:55:00.000Z	Xaero252		I was wondering if there is a tool that I can run to display an overlay on top of X containing information like GPU temperature, CPU Temperature, and usage?
2010-01-04T15:56:00.000Z	Xaero252		I know conky works for the desktop but that doesnt really help me monitor the temperature when I'm doing full-screen rendering or CUDA based calculation
2010-01-04T15:57:00.000Z	Xaero252		I've tried adding conky to a widget layer in compiz but that just results in conky's "transparency" failing hard
