2009-11-18T04:36:00.000Z	arand	Um_cara_qualquer	What application, what version, does a debian package not exist?
2009-11-18T04:39:00.000Z	arand	Um_cara_qualquer	are you using 9.04 or 9.10?
2009-11-18T04:41:00.000Z	arand	Um_cara_qualquer	okay, the easiest way would probably be to add this ppa: https://launchpad.net/~philip5/+archive/extra
2009-11-18T04:43:00.000Z	arand	Um_cara_qualquer	hmm, yea, so it works like a repository. (that factoid was not particulary informative in this case)
