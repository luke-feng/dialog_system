2008-04-14T12:12:00.000Z	gluonman		I am trying to send a video to my friend who is using Windows XP and I have Linux ubuntu. I have to compress the files into an archive in order for them to fit in an e-mail, but can my newly made tar.gz be usable at all on her computer?

2008-04-14T12:15:00.000Z	gluonman	Jordan_U	how do you make a zip file in Linux?
