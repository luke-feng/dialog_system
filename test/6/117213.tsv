2007-12-17T11:45:00.000Z	tarelerulz		Well, thanks Cubexombi, iy  would be nice to have an os on thumbstick and having the option to install it to the computer you have it plugged into
2007-12-17T11:47:00.000Z	tarelerulz		 Cubexombi, I have all thought it might be an cool idea . I mean I really do belive it is all data and you should not need a cd . I mean we live in the age of  rewritble  media that is big enough  why not use it.  Plus the nerd factor is there too haha
2007-12-17T11:49:00.000Z	tarelerulz		 Cubexombi, looking for sure I found that Ubuntu made an windows installer for Ubuntu. I thought that was very cool.  really getting Ubuntu to the widest about of people.  For those who might want to try out Linux ,  fear  repartitioning thier card drive . I mean it keep me for Linux for while
2007-12-17T11:50:00.000Z	tarelerulz		 Znuff , I would look at ndiswrapper site
2007-12-17T11:51:00.000Z	Znuff	tarelerulz	guess that would be my almost-last solution.
2007-12-17T11:55:00.000Z	Znuff	tarelerulz	nope.
