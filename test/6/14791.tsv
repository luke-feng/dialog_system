2011-03-28T14:40:00.000Z	Moopz		Hey. My friend is doing an installation of 10.04 on top of a Windows 7. After taking a long time booting etc it asks him for a username and password. No matter what we type in, it doesn't do anything.
2011-03-28T14:41:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Moopz	have you installed already or just booting a live cd?
2011-03-28T14:41:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Moopz	try username : ubuntu and blank password...
2011-03-28T14:41:00.000Z	Moopz	bonjoyee	alright will try once he's done restarting.
2011-03-28T14:43:00.000Z	bonjoyee	Moopz	it should not prompt for it in the first place...but if it does try that..
2011-03-28T14:44:00.000Z	Moopz	bonjoyee	he's still starting up so will try once he's done.
