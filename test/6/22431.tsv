2010-04-22T11:53:00.000Z	crucialhoax	obscurant1st	Does a switch fit the bill?
2010-04-22T11:53:00.000Z	obscurant1st	crucialhoax	no, i dont have switch or router, actually i just need to connect my my iphone to wifi
2010-04-22T11:54:00.000Z	crucialhoax	obscurant1st	So a wireless router will work then. It has a 4 port switch for your wired connections and wireless for the iPhone.
