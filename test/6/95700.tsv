2007-07-07T15:34:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	TaJMoX	what settings do you use?
2007-07-07T15:34:00.000Z	TaJMoX	AnObfuscator	XGL  ... i can't use aiglx with the fglrx driver (ATI Mobility X1300)
2007-07-07T15:35:00.000Z	AnObfuscator	TaJMoX	ah, I use aiglx, so YMMV (XGL had tons of java swing issues for me, that were showstopping)
2007-07-07T15:35:00.000Z	TaJMoX	AnObfuscator	yeah until ATI comes out with a driver that supports my card - I'm stuck with fglrx and XGL for beryl ...which pretty much burns a hole in my CPU and leaks memmory pretty quick
