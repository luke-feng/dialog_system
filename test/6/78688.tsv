2007-09-25T14:59:00.000Z	tretle		<murkyMurk> you should think twice before recomending cedega... it may work better than wine for games but the fact that it the offspring of wine(opensource project) and they charge cedega is just Hilarius... Plus windows emulation may be a good alternative for the time being but encouraging people to give up on native ports as cedega generally does is just wrong
2007-09-25T15:01:00.000Z	tretle		<murkyMurk> I understand your point but that doesnt stop the fact they are selling partial ex opensource code in their own name... I dont see them paying ex wine contributers for their contribution to the cedega project
2007-09-25T15:03:00.000Z	tretle		yes... and as it was greatly publicized over the last few months... that licence was flawed... I still count it as plagiarism
2007-09-25T15:04:00.000Z	tretle		its wine repackaged and sold as if their own
2007-09-25T15:04:00.000Z	tretle		with mods to increase compatability in requested games
2007-09-25T15:04:00.000Z	seth_m	tretle	The cedega people forked the X11 code (as that license allows). This is legal and honest, if not seedy.
