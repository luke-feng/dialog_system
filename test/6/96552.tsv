2008-04-23T07:09:00.000Z	Pici	woodwizzle	Click the little unsubscribe button on the left when you are logged in and looking at the bug
2008-04-23T07:10:00.000Z	woodwizzle	Pici	Ah OK, but how can I unsubscribe from all of 'em that I'm subscribed to? or at least see a complete list?
2008-04-23T07:11:00.000Z	Pici	woodwizzle	Probably on your user page under bugs, #launchpad for further questions :)
2008-04-23T07:11:00.000Z	woodwizzle	Pici	oh ok, sorry I musta spelled launchpad wrong in the channel search and didn't find a channel
2008-04-23T07:12:00.000Z	Pici	woodwizzle	no need to apologize
