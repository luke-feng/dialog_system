2010-09-08T23:42:00.000Z	UberStudenter		hello... i try different live cds and each time i have to download drivers and firmwares for my wireless.. is there a way to save a file on a usb and then just install it from there instead of the package manager

2010-09-08T23:45:00.000Z	UberStudenter	Fishscene	how is that going to help me
2010-09-08T23:47:00.000Z	Fishscene	UberStudenter	I'm not sure if it would work, but if you use a live-USB key, you can save data on it so you don't have to set everything up again the next time you boot.
2010-09-08T23:48:00.000Z	UberStudenter	Fishscene	i think maybe i dint' explain .. i try different live cd/dvd distros and i have to donwload the same drivers/firmware for my wireless in each distro...
2010-09-08T23:49:00.000Z	Fishscene	UberStudenter	ah ok. My misunderstanding.
