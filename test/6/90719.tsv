2007-06-17T15:03:00.000Z	eduhat	shawn34	oh. the guide says to run wine. thank you :)
2007-06-17T15:08:00.000Z	eduhat	shawn34	do i need to install the microsoft core fonts or do i just need the tahoma font?
2007-06-17T15:10:00.000Z	eduhat	shawn34	do you have an answer for my question above?
2007-06-17T15:11:00.000Z	shawn34	eduhat	depends on the app your going to install, but would it just make more sense to install all of them just in case?
2007-06-17T15:11:00.000Z	eduhat	shawn34	well i would install them. but i dont know how. the guide there is for an rpm based install.
