2007-12-09T01:10:00.000Z	Areli2	vocx	That's not an old card. Before this i had an ATI Radeon 9250. (And don't worry, i've reinstalled Ubuntu)
2007-12-09T01:11:00.000Z	Areli2	vocx	and the computer's really fast
2007-12-09T01:11:00.000Z	Areli2	vocx	and other games work just fine.
2007-12-09T01:11:00.000Z	vocx	Areli2	in that case, I envy you.
