2005-07-11T14:02:00.000Z	zeenix		i installed ubuntu on this newly bought notebook of mine yesterday and all was working good but this monring when i booted, it gave me a kernel panic
2005-07-11T14:02:00.000Z	zeenix		i rebooted many times but it didnt help, so i tried something very stupid: re-install grub
2005-07-11T14:02:00.000Z	zeenix		but the grub didn't install successfully and now even the grub doesn't load successfully
