2008-03-05T06:36:00.000Z	ali1234	victamower	i use mythbuntu for that
2008-03-05T06:38:00.000Z	ali1234	victamower	technically no, you can install the ubuntu desktop packages on it
2008-03-05T06:39:00.000Z	ali1234	victamower	it is, but it's the best there is if you want to record things
2008-03-05T06:40:00.000Z	ali1234	victamower	sure. it has a web interface even.
2008-03-05T06:40:00.000Z	ali1234	victamower	actually, *live* is a bit of a sticky issue, but "almost" live seems to work okay
