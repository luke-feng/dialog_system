2005-03-08T14:36:00.000Z	ions		ah cool
2005-03-08T14:36:00.000Z	ions		thanks
2005-03-08T11:15:00.000Z	ions		can anyone point me in the direction of how to install GnomeBaker?  I know where the repo is but I don't know what to do with it
2005-03-08T11:16:00.000Z	cg0def	ions	check the GnomeBaker site
