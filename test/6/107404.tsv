Specifically I need one with a good notification system (notify new threads, to which i've contributed, to which my friends have contributed etc), digest functionality etc. Does _not_ have to be free, but less than 3000 euros.

2006-10-06T14:03:00.000Z	bionoid	mneptok	Ok - reading their feature list I only see one item on notification, that of threads yourself contributed to. Says nothing about digest or more advanced notification, so it doesn't seem to fit my requirements :(
