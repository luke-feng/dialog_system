2008-01-29T21:45:00.000Z	kdub	hk2999	there's a little checkbox you have to click, its real annoying, i should recode it/put it in some blueprints somewhere... :-)
2008-01-29T21:46:00.000Z	hk2999	kdub	the inv checkbox?
2008-01-29T21:46:00.000Z	hk2999		it takes the arcsine instead though...
2008-01-29T21:46:00.000Z	kdub	hk2999	yeah, that one
2008-01-29T21:47:00.000Z	kdub	hk2999	isnt the arcsine the same thing as inverse sine?
