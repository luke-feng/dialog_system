2006-01-07T15:09:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		i have to clean install or can i use some partition program to do it
2006-01-07T15:09:00.000Z	psusi	ThePyromaniac	could you be more specific?  do you want to keep windows and share the drive?  or screw windows and you just want to copy your ubuntu install from your old drive to a new one?
2006-01-07T15:12:00.000Z	psusi	ThePyromaniac	the easiest way is to just reinstall ubuntu on the smaller drive... it should automatically shrink the windows partition and use the free space, then blow away the ubuntu partition on the big drive
