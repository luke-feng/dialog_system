2011-05-10T23:39:00.000Z	victorhugo289		Has any of you noticed that when Ubuntu starts you will momentarily see a different wallpaper if you've been on a different Ubuntu in the same Hard drive?
2011-05-10T23:40:00.000Z	victorhugo289		I think Ubuntu doesn't clear the memory completely when it shuts down
2011-05-10T23:40:00.000Z	victorhugo289		I just pressed F12, but I didn't know what it was for.
2011-05-10T23:40:00.000Z	maco	victorhugo289	is that on a warm reboot or even on cold boots hours later?
2011-05-10T23:41:00.000Z	maco	victorhugo289	it does take up to like 5 minutes of no more power in the system for memory to ...lose its memory
