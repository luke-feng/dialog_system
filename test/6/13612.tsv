2011-01-22T06:36:00.000Z	acicula	mellin	eclipse, but its also in the application menu
2011-01-22T06:37:00.000Z	mellin	acicula	That was what I tried, but alt+F2 didn't execute it. I checked the software center and it shows installed...hmmmm
2011-01-22T06:38:00.000Z	acicula	mellin	odd, try opening a console and typing eclipse, hit tab and see what comes up
2011-01-22T06:39:00.000Z	mellin	acicula	Ok will do thanks all!
2011-01-22T06:41:00.000Z	mellin	acicula	Also this didn't run the executable...
