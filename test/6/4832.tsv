2011-12-28T17:36:00.000Z	keratacon		I did something stupid and rm'ed the contents of /etc/apache2, thinking that if I removed the package and reinstalled it, I'd get a new /etc/apache2 with all the defaults restored.  Turns out that didn't work, and now /etc/apache2 is still empty.  Is there a way to get the apache2 package to rebuild those directories and files?
2011-12-28T17:37:00.000Z	axtheb	keratacon	did you really purged the package?
2011-12-28T17:37:00.000Z	keratacon	axtheb	think so, but for reference, how do I do that?
