2008-02-21T22:45:00.000Z	Desert_Storm		Hey
2008-02-21T22:46:00.000Z	Desert_Storm		If i want to dual boot gentoo and Ubuntu, Ubuntu on prim drive, and gentoo on sec drive, do i need to mess with jumpers?
2008-02-21T22:47:00.000Z	Desert_Storm		Grub...?
2008-02-21T22:47:00.000Z	Desert_Storm		Dual boot with ubuntu
2008-02-21T22:47:00.000Z	Desert_Storm		Some said gentoo is faster
2008-02-21T22:48:00.000Z	TurtleOfDoom	Desert_Storm	I would strongly disagree with the whole "faster" but it's up to you
