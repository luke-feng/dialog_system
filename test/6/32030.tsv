2011-06-17T17:56:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ashwin	No restore point, per say; you should back-up, then you can "restore"...Afterall that's what restore does in windows. :-)
2011-06-17T18:37:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ashwin	Perhaps, the best thing to try is back-up all of your video, music, docs., etc...and reinstall ubuntu.
2011-06-17T18:38:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ashwin	Or kubuntu, as the case may be.
2011-06-17T18:40:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ashwin	I'm sure there is but I don't know the exact steps to perform same. :-(...Sorry.
2011-06-17T18:42:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	ashwin	I know it's after the fact, but, the best way to avoid this problem in the future is to back-up your home directory to an external drive; that way a reinstall will retain all of your settings and configs; once you have copied your home to the new install.
