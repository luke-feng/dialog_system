2007-02-17T10:53:00.000Z	vox754	underdog5004	I use the console to set wireless. The IRC client can be GAIM but he can install Xchat.
2007-02-17T10:54:00.000Z	underdog5004	vox754	so...iwconfig?
2007-02-17T10:54:00.000Z	vox754	underdog5004	YES sir.

2007-02-17T10:55:00.000Z	vox754	underdog5004	remember the terminal is great because it does stuff regardless of the desktop, or graphical frontends.
