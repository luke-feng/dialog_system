2009-11-20T23:36:00.000Z	PacketCollision	nether	what card do you have?
2009-11-20T23:39:00.000Z	PacketCollision	nether	try lspci |grep Wireless
2009-11-20T23:42:00.000Z	PacketCollision	nether	that card should work afaik
2009-11-20T23:55:00.000Z	PacketCollision	nether	I recommend installing aircrack-ng from source
