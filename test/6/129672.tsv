2008-08-22T12:56:00.000Z	Kahless		is there a que to get help?
2008-08-22T12:57:00.000Z	Kahless		I am trying to use an unbuntu live CD version 7.10 usually it loads teh linux kernal pretty damn quick but on this DELL XPS 410 is has been over half and hour and is onyl at 49%
2008-08-22T12:58:00.000Z	Kahless		Is there a reason why it could be taking forever to load the kernal off the cd I mean is a very recent computer
2008-08-22T12:58:00.000Z	alistair_	Kahless	have you tried another burn of the cdrom?
2008-08-22T12:59:00.000Z	alistair_	Kahless	I find CD are really not as robust as they are made out to be likely is cause of your problem
