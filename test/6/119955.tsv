2007-04-20T12:23:00.000Z	Ademan	ExpositionOFEvil	you should use the torrent...
2007-04-20T12:24:00.000Z	Ademan	ExpositionOFEvil	maybe your burn was bad? because the torrent should check for data integrity
2007-04-20T12:28:00.000Z	Ademan	ExpositionOFEvil	then it's your burner, try burning at a lower speed
2007-04-20T12:30:00.000Z	Ademan	ExpositionOFEvil	i always burn at 2x just to be safe because even though my burner says like 16x or something, i always get errors at that speed
2007-04-20T14:09:00.000Z	Ademan	ExpositionOFEvil	your burner not work?
