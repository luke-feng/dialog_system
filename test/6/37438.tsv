2009-07-06T09:49:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Plug and Play is a Windows thing.
2009-07-06T09:49:00.000Z	Jimmio	Curly_Q	Yeah, Plug and Play doesn't exist in Linux... it just works.
2009-07-06T09:49:00.000Z	Jimmio	Curly_Q	Or is that (tm) Apple? Meh.
2009-07-06T09:50:00.000Z	Curly_Q	Jimmio	Apple is simply a Windows thing too.
2009-07-06T09:50:00.000Z	Jimmio	Curly_Q	Uhh... What? xP
