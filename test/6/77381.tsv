2009-07-14T22:14:00.000Z	bdesham		hello all... any idea when firefox 3.5 will become the "main" firefox package under ubuntu?
2009-07-14T22:14:00.000Z	bazhang	bdesham	in the next release
2009-07-14T22:15:00.000Z	bdesham	bazhang	you mean the next major release of ubuntu?  thanks.  (I'm a relative newbie with linux package management)
2009-07-14T22:16:00.000Z	bazhang	bdesham	it is available now, called shiretoko when you install it
2009-07-14T22:16:00.000Z	bdesham	bazhang	I saw that, I was wondering when 3.5 would become the "default", branded version of firefox
