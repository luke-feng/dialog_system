2007-06-21T09:48:00.000Z	nrdb		Is there anyone here able to test a very simple 15 line C program for me, on a MACOS X ?
2007-06-21T09:48:00.000Z	wols	nrdb	wrong channel
2007-06-21T09:48:00.000Z	nrdb	wols	just asking don't know anyone with one.
2007-06-21T09:49:00.000Z	wols	nrdb	it's still OT in here. ask #C or #osx or whatever. tho running foreign programs from itc is s dumb thing to do
2007-06-21T09:50:00.000Z	nrdb	wols	it very simple only uses 3 standard functions 4 if you include printf.
2007-06-21T09:51:00.000Z	wols	nrdb	it's a foreign binary which means unless whoever runs it also compiles it himself from source, it could be a trojan. now please stop it's OT
