2007-01-17T06:03:00.000Z	user-land		Until now that stopped when i quit Firefox.
2007-01-17T06:03:00.000Z	user-land		But now it persists.
2007-01-17T06:04:00.000Z	user-land		Do you see that happening too and is there anything i can do short of log-out ?
2007-01-17T06:04:00.000Z	riotkittie	user-land	is it Xorg itself or something in Xorg  ?
