2008-09-17T10:22:00.000Z	circs		When i am poking around for themes for ubuntu what should I be looking for? I tried every category on gnome look and nothing seems to work, did I break it by installing compiz-fusion?
2008-09-17T10:23:00.000Z	Flannel	circs	Ubuntu uses gnome, so any gnome themes ought to work
2008-09-17T10:23:00.000Z	Flannel		!theme | circs
2008-09-17T10:24:00.000Z	circs	Flannel	I found plenty of them I just can't get any to work
2008-09-17T10:25:00.000Z	Flannel	circs	I believeyou just drag the theme tgzs to the theme window thing.  I think thats how it works.
2008-09-17T10:26:00.000Z	circs	Flannel	It tell me that the theme is invalid, either that or emerald sees it and imports it then does nothing whatsoever
