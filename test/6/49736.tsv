2009-04-28T08:25:00.000Z	mythbuster1848		Hello. Can anyone tell me if there's a special channel for dealing with differences between Fedora and Ubuntu? I just switched from Fedora to Jaunty and stuff I used to know how to do doesn'r work quite the same way
2009-04-28T08:26:00.000Z	mythbuster1848		On Fedora, I used to run Ktorrent headless, on Xvfb
2009-04-28T08:27:00.000Z	mythbuster1848		I installed Xvfb from the Ubuntu repositories, and now it's giving me grief
2009-04-28T08:27:00.000Z	mythbuster1848		will rtorrent give me a webUI?
2009-04-28T08:27:00.000Z	mythbuster1848		I don't know if my Xvfb problems are a configuration thing or a Jaunty bug
2009-04-28T08:28:00.000Z	losher	mythbuster1848	don't think so. google it & then come back & tell us the answer
