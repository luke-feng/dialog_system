2011-05-02T17:47:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	m4k	Do you have connectivity with the machine, does ping work?
2011-05-02T17:47:00.000Z	m4k	GeorgeJ	i can ping with ip but not machine name
2011-05-02T17:48:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	m4k	Either add a line in /etc/hosts to add an allias to that machine as ActionParsnip suggested or isntall samba.
