2009-06-11T23:14:00.000Z	mdm	jontec	it can not open your display it is either not set, or you do not have xvideo
2009-06-11T23:14:00.000Z	mdm	jontec	try export DISPLAY=:0 and then try adding -vo x11 to it
2009-06-11T23:14:00.000Z	jontec	mdm	I'm not the guy with the video problem... I have the wireless problem
