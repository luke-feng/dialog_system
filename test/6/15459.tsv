2010-10-29T19:13:00.000Z	Isenn		I can not install ubuntu 10.10.. The installation is freezing at "around 75%" procent? is the installation material broken?
2010-10-29T19:14:00.000Z	Isenn		Or is there any workaround
2010-10-29T19:14:00.000Z	jrib	Isenn	did you "check the cd for defects"?  i.e. checksum the cd?
2010-10-29T19:15:00.000Z	jrib	Isenn	you need to checksum the cd
2010-10-29T19:15:00.000Z	Isenn	jrib	where is the checksum?
2010-10-29T19:16:00.000Z	jrib	Isenn	the link would tells you... see UbuntuHashes
