2008-07-24T21:55:00.000Z	I_Am		sorry but which one should i uninstall
2008-07-24T21:56:00.000Z	I_Am		firefox or firefow-3.0
2008-07-24T21:57:00.000Z	bobertdos	I_Am	I actually suggest you leave them both alone. Firefox is just the meta package. Firefox-3.0 is the main browser.
2008-07-24T21:58:00.000Z	bobertdos	I_Am	Are you running Hardy Heron from a fresh install or did you do an upgrade?
2008-07-24T22:00:00.000Z	bobertdos	I_Am	Well, I guess I would uninstall Firefox if I had to choose between the two.
