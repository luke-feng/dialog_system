2008-07-13T21:18:00.000Z	hateball	sdakak	No
2008-07-13T21:19:00.000Z	hateball	sdakak	Not at the moment no sdakak
2008-07-13T21:20:00.000Z	hateball	sdakak	But you can try Wine
2008-07-13T21:20:00.000Z	sdakak	hateball	ActionParsnip: Do you know whether cedega has better directx support than wine?
2008-07-13T21:20:00.000Z	hateball	sdakak	For some games perhaps... but it always makes it into Wine after a while
