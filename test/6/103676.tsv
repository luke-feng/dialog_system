2007-05-17T12:28:00.000Z	scheuri	QuixoticJ	VMware player and server are free (however, not opensource)...there are indeed loads of programs out there to have virtual machines
2007-05-17T12:29:00.000Z	scheuri	QuixoticJ	some do a better job with windows, some little less good...:)....I personally know that vmware (server) works very good
2007-05-17T12:31:00.000Z	scheuri	QuixoticJ	yes it is....
2007-05-17T12:31:00.000Z	scheuri	QuixoticJ	however, your linux or other windows virtual machines are not affected
2007-05-17T12:31:00.000Z	QuixoticJ	scheuri	but it shouldnt get to bad if i just pop it on for a quick use of an app and then back off right?
