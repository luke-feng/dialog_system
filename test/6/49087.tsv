2008-10-25T05:06:00.000Z	perillux		I want to put a small minimal windows installation onto a separate partition on this computer.  What I'm wondering is.. could I possibly use an installation CD that was made for another computer on this computer?  I'm thinking that CD will install video drivers and everything for that other comp.. would I still be able to at least use it so I can install the proper drivers, will this work at all??

2008-10-25T05:15:00.000Z	Tom_Davis	perillux	not gonna happen
