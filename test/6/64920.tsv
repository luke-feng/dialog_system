2008-03-22T10:51:00.000Z	mark[oz]	unop_	that didn't help at all
2008-03-22T10:51:00.000Z	mark[oz]	unop_	can I ask which codecs you use for video?
2008-03-22T10:52:00.000Z	unop_	mark[oz]	it depends on the individual type of video you are trying to play -- e.g. mpeg videos require a set of codecs, avi's another, etc etc
2008-03-22T10:52:00.000Z	unop_	mark[oz]	i have the w32codecs install as well as codecs from mplayer
2008-03-22T10:56:00.000Z	mark[oz]	unop_	mplayer still sucks
2008-03-22T10:57:00.000Z	unop_	mark[oz]	i'm not sure then
