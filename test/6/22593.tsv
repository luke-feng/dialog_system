2010-04-02T23:17:00.000Z	progre55		yeah, dual
2010-04-02T23:18:00.000Z	hashed_	progre55	it's a whole lot easier when windows is installed first :)
2010-04-02T23:19:00.000Z	progre55	hashed_	it is installed.. it's the native os for the vaio I just bought
2010-04-02T23:24:00.000Z	hashed_	progre55	you should definitely resize the windows partition with a gparted or partedmagic to avoid data loss
2010-04-02T23:24:00.000Z	progre55	hashed_	but doesnt ubuntu use gparted while repartitioning?
