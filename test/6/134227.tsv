2005-12-17T12:05:00.000Z	Topazworm		Im fed up with this
2005-12-17T12:06:00.000Z	Topazworm		It shouldnt be god damn rocket science to get ONE hard drive to work. Ive tried scripts and codes and nothing!
2005-12-17T12:07:00.000Z	Topazworm		Firefox is knackered, i cant access my ntfs drive for my files, and my 2 partitioned drives i cant access because it tells me "You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "hdb5"." ARGH
2005-12-17T12:07:00.000Z	mustard5	Topazworm	there is a script that can do the mounting for you and make the fstab entries
2005-12-17T12:10:00.000Z	mustard5	Topazworm	if you want to come to a quieter chat room I can show you how to mount your ntfs drives
