2011-05-24T23:33:00.000Z	ziikutv		I clicked on Browse all local disks
2011-05-24T23:33:00.000Z	ziikutv		it shwos all partitions
2011-05-24T23:34:00.000Z	ziikutv		except C drive (where I installed ubuntu as a partition)

2011-05-24T23:34:00.000Z	tensorpudding	ziikutv	are you sure that your windows partition isn't listed?
