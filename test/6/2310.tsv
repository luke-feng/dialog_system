2012-05-03T08:10:00.000Z	wylde	WulRadyansyka	have you made any bug reports? It's quite easy, 'ubuntu-bug gnome-shell' will start the bug filing process and probably include actually useful information to triagers and developers so it can get fixed.
2012-05-03T08:11:00.000Z	wylde	WulRadyansyka	oh? what version of ubuntu are you using?
2012-05-03T08:12:00.000Z	WulRadyansyka	wylde	12.04 with junk removed, apport included
2012-05-03T08:14:00.000Z	wylde	WulRadyansyka	so, basically you have no interest in providing useful information to help resolve issues within ubuntu.
2012-05-03T08:15:00.000Z	WulRadyansyka	wylde	I'm not installing spyware like apport in my system
2012-05-03T08:17:00.000Z	wylde	WulRadyansyka	regardless, you've been asked to provide useful information so people can help you and yet you've not provided nothing with any sort of detail to allow anyone to provide you any type of support. At any rate enjoy your trolling as long as the ops care to put up with you.
