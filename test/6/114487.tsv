2006-06-26T10:08:00.000Z	xBONESstyle		_mikem, there's another program in Ubuntu that lets you stretch the actual screen, and then posts the specs so you know exactly what to change.
2006-06-26T10:09:00.000Z	xBONESstyle		anyway, do you know another way for me to know exactly what to change to regain the square inch of my screen that i'm missing?
2006-06-26T10:10:00.000Z	xBONESstyle		it's an inch of screen space that's not being taken up.
2006-06-26T10:11:00.000Z	xBONESstyle		you can make the change in xorg, because i've used the program before to figure out what to change... i just can't find it anymore
