2009-07-15T04:26:00.000Z	nsadmin		well let's put it this way... I think you can run a periodic script in windows... the mechanism is not called cron and doesn't work like it
2009-07-15T04:28:00.000Z	nsadmin		whether it's good or bad it works different is a subjective value judgement
2009-07-15T04:30:00.000Z	nsadmin		replace it with a cheap console-only card
2009-07-15T04:32:00.000Z	Evelina	nsadmin	Serial console? What's that?
2009-07-15T04:33:00.000Z	nsadmin	Evelina	there used to be no video cards... computers had large banks of serial ports and that's how they talked
