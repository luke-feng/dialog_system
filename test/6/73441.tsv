2008-01-10T20:38:00.000Z	Arelis		Hi all. I've tried Windows as main OS, but... really, i prefer Ubuntu more. Problem is, i've had it breaking on me several times already. I want to dual-boot Windows with Ubuntu, and want Ubuntu to have a /home partition, for easy backup and reinstalling. How do i do all this?
