2009-08-02T09:25:00.000Z	soreau	ironmagma	Try prefixing the command with DISPLAY=:0
2009-08-02T09:26:00.000Z	ironmagma		Getting the same thing
2009-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	ironmagma	soreau	for :0 and :1 I get "No protocol specified" in addition to the other errors
2009-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	ironmagma	soreau	but for :2 I just get the other errors
2009-08-02T09:27:00.000Z	soreau	ironmagma	No idea then
