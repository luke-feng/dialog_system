2007-11-26T23:38:00.000Z	demco		Hi, does anyone know how to get 'blurring' under a transparent terminal window with compiz?
2007-11-26T23:38:00.000Z	demco		What needs to be activated?
2007-11-26T23:39:00.000Z	demco		i've setup the compiz mnager
2007-11-26T23:39:00.000Z	macogw	demco	"blur" i assume
2007-11-26T23:44:00.000Z	macogw	demco	blur is for moving windows
2007-11-26T23:45:00.000Z	macogw	demco	afaik, there's no way to mush what's behind transparency
