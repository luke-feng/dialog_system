2010-04-29T05:40:00.000Z	Stavros		hey, is lucid supposed to be released today?
2010-04-29T05:42:00.000Z	franl	Stavros	http://ubuntu.com/ says "1 day to go", but half the world is already in Thursday, so I don't know when exactly the clock ticks to zero.
2010-04-29T05:44:00.000Z	Stavros	franl	ah, but it's going to be released tomorrow at the latest, though?
2010-04-29T05:44:00.000Z	Stavros		i was searching for a way to install a lucid package on karmic, but if lucid is being released tomorrow i might not have to, in the end
2010-04-29T05:45:00.000Z	franl	Stavros	I don't speak for Ubuntu, but the date has been advertised for some time, so I believe it.
2010-04-29T05:45:00.000Z	Stavros	franl	i know... should be tomorrow then, thanks!
