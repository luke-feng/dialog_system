2011-02-26T05:01:00.000Z	Vitasoy	Starminn	I didn't know you could make windows images off UNetBootin
2011-02-26T05:03:00.000Z	Vitasoy	Starminn	correct=p but auro1 doesn't have blank cds
2011-02-26T05:03:00.000Z	Vitasoy	Starminn	So I don't think he can use unetbootin to make an USB bootable for a Windows7 image - I think it won't work
2011-02-26T05:03:00.000Z	Starminn	Vitasoy	auro1: Well that isn't cool. Alright, auro1, ask in the ##windows channel how to make Windows on a flash drive (*if* you can then ask in here for mroe details if needed) (assuming you have another flash drive)
2011-02-26T05:04:00.000Z	Starminn	Vitasoy	Neither do I.
