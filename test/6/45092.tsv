2009-01-10T21:27:00.000Z	giganto		something like those fancy system monitors
2009-01-10T21:27:00.000Z	the_squircle	giganto	i think there's one you can add to the GNOME panel.
2009-01-10T21:28:00.000Z	giganto	the_squircle	i see, so there isn't any that floats above the background image?
2009-01-10T21:28:00.000Z	the_squircle	giganto	i'm sure there are.... I just don't know of them. try looking in synaptic
2009-01-10T21:28:00.000Z	giganto	the_squircle	yeah im looking at the moment.
