2011-08-12T19:52:00.000Z	lucenut		I have an HP Mini netbook that will only take 1G RAM and I'd like to install ubuntu and have it dual boot. It currently has Windows 7.
2011-08-12T19:52:00.000Z	lucenut		I have downloaded the 9.04 netbook remix and the 11.04 iso.
2011-08-12T19:53:00.000Z	lucenut		Isn't an iso for burning a CD?
2011-08-12T19:53:00.000Z	lucenut		Can't do much with it on the netbook. Don't most netbooks not have CDRs?
