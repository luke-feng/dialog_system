2007-09-25T10:07:00.000Z	Al00		g'day folks -- I have a fairly simple question (at least in my fragile mind): Is it possible to attach a sound to the window minimize and maximize events? (kinda like winbloze)
2007-09-25T10:07:00.000Z	Al00		I am using Ubuntu (Gnome)

2007-09-25T10:11:00.000Z	Al00	sethk	thanks - I'd like to stay with Gnome... KDE makes me dizzy :D
2007-09-25T10:11:00.000Z	sethk	Al00	wouldn't want you do be dizzy.  :)
2007-09-25T10:12:00.000Z	Al00	sethk	lol - yeah... don't want to blow chunks for sound
