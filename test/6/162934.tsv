2004-11-03T15:40:00.000Z	Lathiat	kaput	should be fine, unless you need some binary drivers like nvidia etc (which are included anyway)
2004-11-03T15:42:00.000Z	Lathiat	kaput	there could be a number of reasons, are you on battery? maybe your cpu frequency was scaled
2004-11-03T15:48:00.000Z	Lathiat	kaput	thought the gnome applet changed it
2004-11-03T15:49:00.000Z	Lathiat	kaput	have you tried it?
2004-11-03T15:55:00.000Z	Lathiat	kaput	no idea sorry
