2007-03-12T10:10:00.000Z	KevlarSoul		seriously?
2007-03-12T10:10:00.000Z	jvolkman	KevlarSoul	because MS doesn't do all of the same things.
2007-03-12T10:11:00.000Z	KevlarSoul	jvolkman	like what whats the big feature or benefit that Linux has over MS?
2007-03-12T10:11:00.000Z	jvolkman	KevlarSoul	there is no one big feature or benefit.
2007-03-12T10:12:00.000Z	jvolkman	KevlarSoul	there are pros and cons, just like with any comparsion between any two entities
