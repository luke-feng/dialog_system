2010-05-04T02:32:00.000Z	altitron	sebsebseb	 thanks, sorry I didn't checked the app. menue.
2010-05-04T02:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	altitron	ok no problem :)
2010-05-04T02:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	altitron	pitvvi does look nice,  just like their simple scan program does,  but I don't have anything to use either for at the moment
2010-05-04T02:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	altitron	also I want to be exact, Canonical/Ubuntu didn't make pitvvi, however they did make simple scan
