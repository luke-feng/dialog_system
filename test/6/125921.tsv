2006-06-16T09:38:00.000Z	gamma		anyone know if it's possible to rename an ipod in linux?
2006-06-16T09:38:00.000Z	blanky	gamma	probably in banshee, though don't look forward to it, I often see myself using windows for ipod maneuvers since I don't want to risk anything
2006-06-16T09:38:00.000Z	blanky	gamma	possibly you can even do it through some file editing
2006-06-16T09:39:00.000Z	gamma	blanky	banshee seems to just update its own database so that when that ipod is detected it renames it in it's list view
2006-06-16T09:39:00.000Z	gamma		but it doesn't actually rename it
2006-06-16T09:39:00.000Z	blanky	gamma	ah, like I said so far all I've seen is reading those types of settings in linux, but I forget which app I heard of which can do this
