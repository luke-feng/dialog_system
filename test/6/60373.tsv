2008-04-12T19:53:00.000Z	TerrorismSux		should i download the x86 or 64 bit ?
2008-04-12T19:53:00.000Z	TerrorismSux		i have 64 bit pc, but will that cause problems with sound/video/wlan and games?
2008-04-12T19:53:00.000Z	Seveas	TerrorismSux	flash won't work. Same for w32codecs (wmv/wma)
2008-04-12T19:57:00.000Z	Seveas	TerrorismSux	x86_64 is just as stable. Some closed source things are simply not available for it
2008-04-12T20:06:00.000Z	Seveas	TerrorismSux	offtopic talk elsewhere
2008-04-12T20:07:00.000Z	TerrorismSux	Seveas	and dmsuperman must be related to my wife
