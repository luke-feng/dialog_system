2012-01-14T06:18:00.000Z	alien2050	RokcStar	not from scratch but I usually play a lot with it so ask your Q
2012-01-14T06:19:00.000Z	alien2050	RokcStar	someone may be able to help
2012-01-17T05:49:00.000Z	alien2050	RokcStar	there are many but NFS works really well
2012-01-17T05:51:00.000Z	alien2050	RokcStar	yes, but the client only so you need some *nix box setup. I think the server will require a license or something, there might be other free solutions for windows, I don't know.
