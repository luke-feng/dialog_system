2009-05-14T02:26:00.000Z	SkyLeach	Dr_Willis	wrong.  winex (transgaming) installs a lot of directx support for games and tweaked dlls.
2009-05-14T02:27:00.000Z	SkyLeach		if you are a gamer under linux, use transgaming.  it'll save a lot of time and headaches.
2009-05-14T02:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SkyLeach	 but they DONT install 'directx'  they have their own tweaked version.
2009-05-14T02:27:00.000Z	SkyLeach	Dr_Willis	true enough
2009-05-14T02:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SkyLeach	 from what i have read over the forums insttaling directx itself can cause worse issues.
2009-05-14T02:28:00.000Z	SkyLeach	Dr_Willis	from what I have ever seen/heard installing anything from microsoft does that, so it's not fair to blame directx ;-)
