2005-10-01T08:54:00.000Z	mazzabr	darkbutterfly	try alsamixer
2005-10-01T08:54:00.000Z	mazzabr	darkbutterfly	probably the volume at alsamixer is low
2005-10-01T08:55:00.000Z	mazzabr	darkbutterfly	sorry then, that was the default answer.
2005-10-01T08:55:00.000Z	mazzabr	darkbutterfly	was the sound working util then?
