2007-03-18T07:47:00.000Z	balzac	voltagex	 you didn't make the proper sacrifice to the cron gods
2007-03-18T07:48:00.000Z	voltagex	balzac	that's not helpful, I"m currently being laughed at for my choice of distro in #linux
2007-03-18T07:49:00.000Z	voltagex	balzac	yes
2007-03-18T07:50:00.000Z	balzac	voltagex	i would ask the distro of the people laughing at your distro
2007-03-18T08:03:00.000Z	voltagex	balzac	I don't even want to think about the default desktop background on that one
