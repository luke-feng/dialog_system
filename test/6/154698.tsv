2005-05-21T09:20:00.000Z	CarlK	KarlosII	- the security patch may be in to Hoary, just not everything else that was added
2005-05-21T09:22:00.000Z	KarlosII	CarlK	security patch?
2005-05-21T09:23:00.000Z	CarlK	KarlosII	- ff fixed a "security issue" that is part of the latestes ver, but the "ubuntu way" is to not add new fetures to the "stable" version (Hoary), just fix security issues
2005-05-21T09:25:00.000Z	KarlosII	CarlK	I haven't seen that fix in my updates since the announcement...but I'll have a closer look
