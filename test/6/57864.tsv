2010-06-04T15:09:00.000Z	ranjan		how can i block google talk using squid proxy??
2010-06-04T15:10:00.000Z	SwedeMike	ranjan	that's not really an ubuntu question.
2010-06-04T15:10:00.000Z	ranjan	SwedeMike	Thats not the answer i want.
2010-06-04T15:11:00.000Z	SwedeMike	ranjan	eiter it's a "how does google talk communicate over http"-question, or it's a squid question "how do I implement this filter in squid", neither is really on-topic for #ubuntu.
