2011-09-10T16:39:00.000Z	Frots		my system freeze completely when using any libtorrent (rasterbar or the other one) based clients (rtorrent or deluge), there is no log entry or error, I have to do hard reboot to get back in the system. other clients dont have any problems ?!?!
2011-09-10T16:41:00.000Z	Frots		no torrent uysers here?
2011-09-10T16:42:00.000Z	Frots		and I dont think it would scale to 1000+ torrents
2011-09-10T16:43:00.000Z	Frots		so no rtorrent or deluge users
