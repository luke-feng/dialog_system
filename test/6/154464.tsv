2005-10-08T10:49:00.000Z	ompaul	Denski	tjhat is not how you deal with a distro, what you do is 'sudo apt-get install gaim' and it gives you the version for your system
2005-10-08T10:57:00.000Z	ompaul	Denski	for what?
2005-10-08T10:59:00.000Z	ompaul	Denski	you install av software if you are providing mail services for windows clients, but Linux to Linux not needed
