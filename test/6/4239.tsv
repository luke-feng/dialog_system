2012-03-02T00:09:00.000Z	zykotic10	Infernall	bot seems to be MIA - that factoid says, the setting a root password is not supported in #ubuntu (you can do it on your own system, but don't ask for help here - sorta thing)
2012-03-02T00:11:00.000Z	Infernall	zykotic10	so were can i go for help? i have no idea what else can i try?
2012-03-02T00:11:00.000Z	zykotic10	Infernall	sorry i haven't been following your actual issue, was just reacting to your "how do i set a root password".  I can't help - good luck.
