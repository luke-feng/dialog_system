2009-04-21T03:29:00.000Z	Huufarted		Possibly OT question for the channel...  In Ubuntu, to sync to an iPod (Nano 4G or Classic 80 GB), will I be required to replace the firmware on the device or will Amarok (or another app) be able to sync music to it without modifying the firmware?

2009-04-21T03:31:00.000Z	Huufarted	Jordan_U	thank you.  :)  Do you know of a resource on a page somewhere that could possibly confirm this?  The reason I ask is I'm buying a Nano 4G for my niece when I go to visit her this summer, but the laptop I'm taking has my music and is Ubuntu.  I want to make sure I can load it up for her.
