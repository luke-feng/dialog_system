2011-02-15T19:03:00.000Z	Mad_Dud		hi guys. could someone help me with remapping "back" button on mouse, to act like middle mouse button?
2011-02-15T19:03:00.000Z	jrib	Mad_Dud	do you still want middle to be middle?
2011-02-15T19:04:00.000Z	Mad_Dud	jrib	it's logitech mx air and technically it does not have middle
2011-02-15T19:05:00.000Z	Mad_Dud	jrib	and this "back" button acts like "back" (in browsers for example) by default out of the box.
