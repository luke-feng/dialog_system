2012-09-25T06:49:00.000Z	MadEchidna		been googling and googling and all I see is vague references to it
2012-09-25T06:49:00.000Z	jagginess	MadEchidna	legacy means for old hardware that arent supported anymore by amd..
2012-09-25T06:49:00.000Z	jagginess	MadEchidna	then check amd's README
2012-09-25T06:50:00.000Z	jagginess	MadEchidna	well it does..
2012-09-25T06:53:00.000Z	jagginess	MadEchidna	embedded linux. You've got to be kidding me. Do you know what embedded linux is?
