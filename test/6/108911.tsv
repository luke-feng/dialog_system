2007-10-03T11:58:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		My alt-tab functionality stopped working altogether.  X has been restarted, reboots have taken place, still dead.  Thoughts?
2007-10-03T11:58:00.000Z	tyler_d	BHSPitMonkey	new keyboard maybe
2007-10-03T11:59:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyler_d	thanks for the tip, but it has nothing to do with the hardware.
2007-10-03T11:59:00.000Z	tyler_d	BHSPitMonkey	do you have compiz installed? or beryl? config in one of those could be an issue as well
2007-10-03T11:59:00.000Z	tyler_d	BHSPitMonkey	yw
2007-10-03T11:59:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	tyler_d	I do, but not running.
