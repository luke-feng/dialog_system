2008-08-24T13:00:00.000Z	montymintypie_	Gin	What happened when you tried?
2008-08-24T13:00:00.000Z	Gin	montymintypie_	the interface was too complicated. but I'm reading a tutorial
2008-08-24T13:01:00.000Z	montymintypie_	Gin	try just selecting the bit you want to delete, then press delete
2008-08-24T13:01:00.000Z	montymintypie_		Then go to file and press 'export to mp3'
2008-08-24T13:08:00.000Z	Gin	montymintypie_	that worked :) Thanks :-)
