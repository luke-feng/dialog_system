2010-08-26T08:29:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	ActionParsnip	that sounds great in theory, but I'm having problems configuring it :)
2010-08-26T09:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dougb_freebsd	i'd go with the adobe one
2010-08-28T10:55:00.000Z	dougb_freebsd	ActionParsnip	true, but nautilus could get confused :)
2010-08-28T10:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dougb_freebsd	nautilus is dumb and should use file rather than silly extensions like windows does, its soooo 1993
2010-09-06T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dougb_freebsd	its not supported here but you can make an equiv using ubuntu and get support here
