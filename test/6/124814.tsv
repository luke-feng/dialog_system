2006-02-26T10:00:00.000Z	Bmur		Few questions: Is Dapper going to retain the brown theme?  I don't necessarily care too much, but I know that other people do.  Will Gnome 2.14 be able to change file permissions recursively from the GUI?  How much of a performance increase are we going to see with Dapper (vs. 5.10)?
2006-02-26T10:00:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bmur	brown - yes, AFAIK. recursive from GUI - no idea, but it would be nice. preformance increase - probably, Breezy is faster here than Hoary was :P
2006-02-26T10:01:00.000Z	Bmur	Madpilot	K, thanks.
2006-02-26T10:03:00.000Z	Bmur		Wastrel: Well, I change it for myself.  ...but brown really isn't a very great default.
2006-02-26T10:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	Bmur	well, it's not blue, or that horribly plastic default XP theme :P
2006-02-26T10:04:00.000Z	Bmur	Madpilot	True.
