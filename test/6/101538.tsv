2009-08-06T23:33:00.000Z	Kjakan		I need some help with filing a bug report.
2009-08-06T23:34:00.000Z	Kjakan		I would like to change the default Visual Effects to None in Ubuntu 10.
2009-08-06T23:34:00.000Z	Kjakan		Change Desktop Background - Appearance Preferences - Visual Effects - None
2009-08-06T23:34:00.000Z	Kjakan		I mean, for the entire distro.
