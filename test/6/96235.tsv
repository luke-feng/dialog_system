2009-08-12T06:17:00.000Z	neutron		I don't know if this goes here, but is this X-chat client truely free and open source? I installed the windows version in windows and now it is asking me to pay :\
2009-08-12T06:18:00.000Z	neutron		however it lists as free/open source in the add/remove manager :P
2009-08-12T06:18:00.000Z	Pici	neutron	Does that have anything to do with Ubuntu?  If you're asking about a windows program then ##windows would be the more appropriate place to ask.
2009-08-12T06:20:00.000Z	Pici	neutron	But you aren't running Ubuntu, you're running Windows.
2009-08-12T06:21:00.000Z	Pici	neutron	If anywhere, #xchat or ##windows would be the proper place to ask, it is offtopic for #ubuntu
2009-08-12T06:22:00.000Z	Pici	neutron	It won't.
