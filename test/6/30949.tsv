2012-08-02T22:33:00.000Z	theadmin		So I was installing Flash (via flashplugin-installer) and my connection went meh during doing so. I removed the package, but now at every boot I get a notification saying "data for flashplugin-installer failed to download, please reinstall the package" or something. How to fix?
