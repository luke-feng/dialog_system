2012-05-14T08:04:00.000Z	axisys		i have a dvd+rw dvd.. but failing to blank it after burning some data in it
2012-05-14T08:04:00.000Z	axisys		Error: this media does not support blanking, ignoring.
2012-05-14T08:04:00.000Z	axisys		This drive or media does not support the 'BLANK media' command
2012-05-14T08:05:00.000Z	axisys		so I must be misunderstanding dvd+rw rewritable label?
2012-05-14T08:05:00.000Z	Resistance	axisys	 is your system capable of handling rewritable disks?
2012-05-14T08:05:00.000Z	Resistance	axisys	 not every CD/DVD burner can work with RW disks
