2010-08-19T11:02:00.000Z	SteveThing	cystic	what are you trying to do with your HTPC? DVR? Blu-Ray playback?
2010-08-19T11:05:00.000Z	SteveThing	cystic	looks like it would work just fine for that... looks like a great deal actually
2010-08-19T11:05:00.000Z	SteveThing	cystic	if you plan on using linux, i'd do some research on that graphics card and HDMI out first... see if it works with linux
2010-08-19T11:08:00.000Z	SteveThing	cystic	well, check the drivers for the motherboard too... the audio chipset might not be compatible... or mayve the gfx card can't output sound over HDMI, just look around for anything that will require a driver... NIC drivers, etc
