2009-05-20T01:10:00.000Z	LjL	system404	ask in #freenode or in #ubuntu-irc if it's an ubuntu channel

2009-05-20T02:58:00.000Z	system404	LjL	howd do i go about setting that up
2009-05-20T02:58:00.000Z	LjL	system404	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/TOR
2009-05-20T02:58:00.000Z	LjL	system404	but keep in mind this sort of thing will intrinsically risk resulting in slowing down your connection.
