2007-02-23T11:25:00.000Z	IceGuest_7		hey all, could someone help me with a question? I seem to have downloaded LIVE CD instead of the real version of Ubuntu... what gives?
2007-02-23T11:25:00.000Z	tritium	IceGuest_7	you can install from the LiveCD
2007-02-23T11:27:00.000Z	tritium	IceGuest_7	choose the "manual" partitioning method
2007-02-23T11:28:00.000Z	tritium	IceGuest_7	for future reference, you don't have to pre-partition
