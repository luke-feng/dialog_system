2006-08-12T09:52:00.000Z	dholmes		Last time I installed AMD64 Ubuntu it had a few problems, like packages I wanted were only available in x86 repositories, and I couldn't get some of my more proprietary hardware to work.  Can anybody tell me if the situation has improved in the past 1.5 year or so?
2006-08-12T09:53:00.000Z	dholmes		I'm trying to decide if I should install AMD64 or just x86
2006-08-12T09:53:00.000Z	dholmes		Okay, thanks
