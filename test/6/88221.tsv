The only workaround I found is temporary and it involves turning off desktop effects and re-enabling right after. The problem is that this fix won't survive a reboot. Any clues?

2009-05-02T18:34:00.000Z	chocobanana	ripps	the blur plugin is turned off. If I turn off desktop effects and turn back on then it displays fonts as it should.
