2009-10-24T10:08:00.000Z	Vague		I was planning to finally upgrade to Jaunty. I have a question though. I did a lot of customizing the look of my Ibex, and I was wondering is there a way I can preserve all of my settings?
2009-10-24T10:09:00.000Z	losha	Vague	why bother? Something you *need* in Jaunty?
2009-10-24T10:09:00.000Z	Vague	losha	I just want to preserve all of my settings O.o the look of my desktop took quite a long time.
2009-10-24T10:10:00.000Z	losha	Vague	and my point was: don't upgrade if you don't need to, and save yourself the potential for a lot of headaches...
2009-10-24T10:10:00.000Z	Vague	losha	ah, I figured there was fresh new stuff in Jaunty
2009-10-24T10:11:00.000Z	losha	Vague	there's always fresh stuff, but if you don't need it or won't use it...
