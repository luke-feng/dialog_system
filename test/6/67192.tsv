2009-01-08T08:46:00.000Z	un_dave	LurkersA	conky would be good for just on a desktop, but i want something fullscreen, and a slideshow of pics is possible
2009-01-08T08:47:00.000Z	un_dave	LurkersA	it wont have a keyboard/mouse attached, so you wont need to be able to see the desktop
2009-01-08T08:48:00.000Z	LurkersA	un_dave	Not sure then. Conky would have been the first choice, mad it fullscreen, but there is bound to be a piece of software for what you want
2009-01-08T08:48:00.000Z	un_dave	LurkersA	yeah, it seems like something common, but i cant find it!
