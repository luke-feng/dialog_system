2010-04-18T02:33:00.000Z	ratatim	crucialhoax	will it offer me the option to upgrade? if not what should I do?
2010-04-18T02:33:00.000Z	crucialhoax	ratatim	there is a command that will force a distro upgrade, I am sure someone in here knows it.
2010-04-18T02:34:00.000Z	ratatim	crucialhoax	thank you.
2010-04-18T02:34:00.000Z	crucialhoax	ratatim	No problem.
