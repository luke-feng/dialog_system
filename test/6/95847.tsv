2008-04-21T01:35:00.000Z	Jill_Not_Jack		New Question: Who can advise me on whether to use 32-bit or 64-bit?
2008-04-21T01:36:00.000Z	Jill_Not_Jack		Drivetrax: Gotcha. Would 32-bit apps still run on 64-bit install? I am leaning towards 64, because it's HELLA faster!
2008-04-21T01:37:00.000Z	unop	Jill_Not_Jack	an OS being 64bit  does not make it faster than a 32bit counterpart .. but yes, you can run 32bit apps on a 64bit system
2008-04-21T01:38:00.000Z	unop	Jill_Not_Jack	i'm positive
2008-04-21T01:43:00.000Z	unop	Jill_Not_Jack	i'm not really interested in vista, my friends have mixed opinions about it, guess it really is down to the individual user on this one, so try it out to see what it is like -- and this is an off-topic question
