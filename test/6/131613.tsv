2005-12-02T17:16:00.000Z	jackie	han`	i figured that much - but on all platforms?
2005-12-02T17:18:00.000Z	han`	jackie	if you are asking, does the mouse send the same commands if it is plugged into the usb port as it does with an adapter, i think basically hte answer is yes...
2005-12-02T17:18:00.000Z	jackie	han`	okay, i was looking for a more technical response though - i'm having an argument with someone and need to be able to prove my point ;D
2005-12-02T17:21:00.000Z	han`	jackie	are you asking if an application will see them as different, or if an os/system level/kernel level piece of software would see them as different?
