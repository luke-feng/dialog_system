2005-05-09T12:40:00.000Z	MuStR		another newb question: is there any way I can view folders that start with periods using nautilus? I ssh'd into my comp and saw them, and want to get some files out of the folders, but I really don't know how to
2005-05-09T12:40:00.000Z	Seveas	MuStR	files and folders that start with a . are the so called 'hidden files'
2005-05-20T10:21:00.000Z	MuStR	Seveas	is there a site I can go to that would help?
2005-05-20T10:22:00.000Z	Seveas	MuStR	look for the ndiswrapperhowto on wiki.ubuntu.com
2005-05-21T16:30:00.000Z	MuStR	Seveas	what other system monitors are there? I know there is one that isn't stacked, but I forgot the name of it.
2005-05-21T16:30:00.000Z	Seveas	MuStR	dunno, i only use some gdesklets for it
