2008-01-18T09:32:00.000Z	bazhang	atomdog2003	plan on keeping it? then burn it to dvd
2008-01-18T09:32:00.000Z	atomdog2003	bazhang	I don't want to burn it
2008-01-18T09:34:00.000Z	bazhang	atomdog2003	video ts can be played with media players in ubuntu as well as vlc
2008-01-20T08:30:00.000Z	bazhang	atomdog2003	you can do that with a browser--but need to have it java enabled and an ethernet connection to the box
2008-01-20T08:31:00.000Z	atomdog2003	bazhang	 nice
