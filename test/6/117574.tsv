2006-05-27T13:37:00.000Z	Madangren		I'm having a problem with Azureus.  None of the ports work.
2006-05-27T13:38:00.000Z	Madangren		I am.  How do I do that?

2006-05-27T13:39:00.000Z	kirkunit	Madangren	try 198.168.0.1, or 198.168.1.1
2006-05-27T13:40:00.000Z	kirkunit	Madangren	192.168.0.1
2006-05-27T13:42:00.000Z	kirkunit	Madangren	port forwarding? can you see that? try 'advanced' options
