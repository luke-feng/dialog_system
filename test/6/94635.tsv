2010-04-28T21:07:00.000Z	EdgEy	_blackwater_	is there something I have to enable?
2010-04-28T21:12:00.000Z	EdgEy	_blackwater_	hmm, do you know if there is any multi-threaded h.264 codec I can get somewhere maybe then? I don't think I even need hardware accel, just it's only using one core anyway
2010-04-28T21:15:00.000Z	EdgEy	_blackwater_	I'm not sure, do I need to install proprietary drivers seperately?
