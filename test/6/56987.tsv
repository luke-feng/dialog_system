2009-05-03T16:20:00.000Z	acron17		can someone give me a hint how to get the configure line for a binary package in ubuntu?
2009-05-03T16:20:00.000Z	raylu	acron17	you could try asking in #ubuntu-motu
2009-05-03T16:20:00.000Z	raylu	acron17	but it may show up somewhere in the files downloaded from "apt-get source package"
2009-05-03T16:21:00.000Z	acron17	raylu	thanks i'll ask there
2009-05-03T16:21:00.000Z	acron17	raylu	right. i'm search already there but with no luck till now...
2009-05-03T16:21:00.000Z	raylu	acron17	oh :(
