2011-06-19T04:46:00.000Z	bazhang	cereal	what game
2011-06-19T04:46:00.000Z	bazhang	cereal	this is linux game or wine
2011-06-19T04:46:00.000Z	bazhang	cereal	you are using *which*
2011-06-19T04:48:00.000Z	bazhang	cereal	where is it installed from, what source
2011-06-19T04:51:00.000Z	cereal	bazhang	i have a feeling it has something to do with java, because sometimes it not only crashes but causes my desktop to act weird, chrome freezes. gnome panel too.
