2011-08-13T21:42:00.000Z	frank	tensorpudding	 ill look into that
2011-08-13T21:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	frank	in ubuntu it's as easy as right-clicking a folder and hitting the share option
2011-08-13T21:43:00.000Z	tensorpudding	frank	there's lots of options that can be configured by tweaking samba, but the simplest options are available more easily
2011-08-13T21:43:00.000Z	frank	tensorpudding	 all i need is samba on both ends?
2011-08-13T21:44:00.000Z	tensorpudding	frank	osx comes with samba, ubuntu you have to install it from the software center
