2010-05-01T06:31:00.000Z	minimec	funkycat90210	some sound problems and a lot of intel gpu problems
2010-05-01T06:32:00.000Z	funkycat90210	minimec	ahh i have a new core i3 with intel gpu integrated and i was waiting for 10.4 to support my chipset so i could ditch windows 7 :(
2010-05-01T06:32:00.000Z	funkycat90210		err core i5
2010-05-01T06:32:00.000Z	funkycat90210		i can't take one more day of win7
2010-05-01T06:33:00.000Z	minimec	funkycat90210	follow the discussion. Intel is not my playground ;)
