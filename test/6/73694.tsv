2007-11-23T02:47:00.000Z	SoundChaser	semperfiguy	how are you going about setting the font in aterm?
2007-11-23T02:48:00.000Z	semperfiguy	SoundChaser	aterm -fn fontname
2007-11-23T02:48:00.000Z	semperfiguy	SoundChaser	snap, one of the artwiz fonts
2007-11-23T02:52:00.000Z	SoundChaser	semperfiguy	look at the man page - it wants a font size, like 7x10...
2007-11-23T02:55:00.000Z	semperfiguy	SoundChaser	I did read the man page, it just says -fn fontname
