2009-06-18T23:41:00.000Z	ectospasm	carthik	anyone with physical access CAN shutdown your machine, there's really no way of preventing that
2009-06-18T23:42:00.000Z	carthik	ectospasm	yeah, well, anyone without physical access, who is not an admin should not be able to shutdown the machine, there.
2009-06-18T23:43:00.000Z	ectospasm	carthik	it's called a power button
2009-06-18T23:43:00.000Z	ectospasm	carthik	I dunno how you can lock that
2009-06-18T23:43:00.000Z	ectospasm	carthik	maybe with a special case/motherboard
