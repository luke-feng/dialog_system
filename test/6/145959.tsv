2005-09-19T12:38:00.000Z	iratsu_		i'm running ubuntu from livecd right now and all i can get is 640x480;
2005-09-19T12:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	iratsu_	check the link ubotu gave you
2005-09-19T12:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	iratsu_	if you went for the "advanced" option there in the x reconfiguration, it's probably better sticking with the medium (which you'd no doubt know)
2005-09-19T12:49:00.000Z	iratsu_	apokryphos	ok i found the rates, should i still use the medium option?
2005-09-19T12:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	iratsu_	probably better in most cases.
