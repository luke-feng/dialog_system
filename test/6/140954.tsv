2005-10-27T14:02:00.000Z	heatheranne		Is this room just for people updating to the new build of Ubuntu?
2005-10-27T14:03:00.000Z	heatheranne		I am new to Linux and even newer to Ubuntu, so I have a general question.  Just tell me if I am not allowed to ask here.
2005-10-27T14:03:00.000Z	heatheranne		Does anyone know of a good embedded media player for firefox?  MPlayer crashes 80% of the time.
