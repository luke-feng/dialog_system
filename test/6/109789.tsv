2006-08-09T13:13:00.000Z	lmosher		I am able to switch my screen over to my TV-out using the built-in buttons, but the second I open an application the colors shift in a freaky way - this does not happen in windows
2006-08-09T13:14:00.000Z	mistform	lmosher	have you updated your video drivers?
2006-08-09T13:14:00.000Z	lmosher		misfit_toy, Well its an ancient card (ati 7500) so yes, but there haven't been many updates :P
2006-08-09T13:14:00.000Z	lmosher	mistform	rather :/
2006-08-09T13:15:00.000Z	lmosher	mistform	I'm really just looking for a video options settings.. Like devices/monitor setup
