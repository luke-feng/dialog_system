2007-05-16T14:09:00.000Z	wxq2378	JammasterJay	select the package you installed and push the "properties" button. there is an installed files tab
2007-05-16T14:12:00.000Z	JammasterJay	wxq2378	so i click on properties, i see the directory where a program is 'installed', like beagle for example: /usr/lib/beagle....so i go there and type 'beagle'?
