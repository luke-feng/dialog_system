2010-04-07T23:27:00.000Z	jrib	h0dg3s	what bash script?
2010-04-07T23:40:00.000Z	jrib	h0dg3s	and what exactly you are typing when you try to run it
2010-04-07T23:46:00.000Z	jrib	h0dg3s	you never answered my question about how you are attempting to execute the script
2010-04-07T23:47:00.000Z	h0dg3s	jrib	yes I did
2010-04-07T23:48:00.000Z	jrib	h0dg3s	when you come back, pastebin your entire session when you try to run the script and the full output
