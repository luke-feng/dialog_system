2005-05-08T05:40:00.000Z	topyli	davegahan	you could creating another user and see if gnome works for it. if so, then it's your settings that's to blame
2005-05-08T05:43:00.000Z	davegahan	topyli	where do I find my startup scripts - settings ?
2005-05-08T05:45:00.000Z	topyli	davegahan	what's failing is probably gnome-session. i'm not sure where its settings live. does gnome work for a virgin user?
