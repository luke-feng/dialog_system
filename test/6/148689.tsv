2006-12-11T08:44:00.000Z	kmaynard	Uzziel	because running programs as root, especially GUI stuff, is not always the best idea. i was wondering what you wanted to do, maybe there's a workaround. but, if you just really want to do it, gksu gdesklets
2006-12-11T08:46:00.000Z	kmaynard	Uzziel	ha....is there something you want to do as a regular user that you cant do? or are you running your desktop as root?
2006-12-11T08:47:00.000Z	kmaynard	Uzziel	you can run as a regular user, and then su -  when you want to stay as root
2006-12-11T08:47:00.000Z	kmaynard	Uzziel	running EVERYTHING as root is dumb.  just fire up the ol' terminal and su -
2006-12-11T08:50:00.000Z	kmaynard	Uzziel	yes you can
