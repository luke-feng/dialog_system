2009-04-17T03:10:00.000Z	Doitle		I am working on a debian package right now for use with apt-get, I know that the install target is called in teh makefile on install, anyone know what one is called on removal?
2009-04-17T03:10:00.000Z	Doitle		or does apt-get completely handle removal itself?
2009-04-17T03:11:00.000Z	Doitle		if you do apt-get remove pckgname
2009-04-17T03:12:00.000Z	Doitle		it will "remove" the package, but I'm not sure what all it does
2009-04-17T03:12:00.000Z	Doitle		I am trying to make a package that gets installed as a service and I can install it as a service, I'm trying to make sure it gets removed as well so the OS does not attempt to start it every boot when it isnt there anymore
