2006-01-05T07:01:00.000Z	Athame		Hello all, I have a complete newbie question. I just installed Ubuntu 5.10 x86 on a dual-boot with xp pro sp2. Running a Radeon x600 pro 256 vid card, Intel pent 4 cpu 3.2 ghz. I get to the upscreen and the system freezes, can't get past that in regular, recovery, or on the live cd. Only other thing is I'm running dual monitors with desktop extended in xp. Any ideas why or how to fix it?
