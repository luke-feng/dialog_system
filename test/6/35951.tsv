2011-12-18T09:33:00.000Z	dio525i		the command that i used "ssh -C -X user@my.se.rv.er gnome-terminal"
2011-12-18T09:34:00.000Z	edbian	dio525i	sometimes it takes a long time to get the gui on the client, especially over the internet
2011-12-18T09:34:00.000Z	edbian	dio525i	It appears to be not working (with no errors) but if you give it like 2 minutes it will work
2011-12-18T09:35:00.000Z	edbian	dio525i	sure
