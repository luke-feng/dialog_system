2008-12-04T11:26:00.000Z	tomcheng76	Ohmu	what is your nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf when the problem exists?
2008-12-04T11:31:00.000Z	Ohmu	tomcheng76	cat /etc/resolv.conf  /// search razer.zone  /// nameserver 203.197.12.30 /// nameserver 202.54.1.18 ///  I'll kill the search line, thats old.  other 2 are correct.
