2009-10-30T03:14:00.000Z	Marfi	Black_Phantom	Need more details than that. Video card? Specs? Age?
2009-10-30T03:15:00.000Z	Marfi	Black_Phantom	You may want to try the alternate CD
2009-10-30T03:15:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	Marfi	does it lack less features ?
2009-10-30T03:15:00.000Z	Marfi	Black_Phantom	Nope, same thing. Just has more boot options
2009-10-30T03:20:00.000Z	Black_Phantom	Marfi	are you sure the alternative cd would work ?
