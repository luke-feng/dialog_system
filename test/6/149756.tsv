2007-12-07T10:02:00.000Z	nickrud	nickname6324	you would need rm -rf (recursive , force )
2007-12-07T10:32:00.000Z	nickrud	nickname6324	my little stuff I use eclipse , emacs , gphpedit , gedit
2007-12-07T10:33:00.000Z	nickrud	nickname6324	I use eclipse in emacs emulation, by the way :)
2007-12-07T10:34:00.000Z	nickrud	nickname6324	more a response to kelsin , and a plug for emacs
2007-12-07T10:35:00.000Z	nickrud	nickname6324	eh, I figured you'd read it all in context, might miss it if directed at kelsin. kelsin seems to follow multiple convo's here easily
