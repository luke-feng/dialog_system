2008-03-20T07:17:00.000Z	joshritger		I just setup ubuntu with wifi for the first time, i type in my password and it connects. do i let keyring manager allow once or allow so it will remember the passkey
2008-03-20T07:17:00.000Z	tritium	joshritger	that's up to you
2008-03-20T07:18:00.000Z	joshritger	tritium	what is the difference? I couldn't find any documentation
2008-03-20T07:19:00.000Z	tritium	joshritger	it's a matter of if you want to type your password each time you log in, or if you want the keyring manager to always remember it
