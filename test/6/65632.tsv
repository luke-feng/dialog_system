2008-03-03T02:54:00.000Z	zugu		hello
2008-03-03T02:54:00.000Z	zugu		I'm running ubuntu 7.10 - if i install kuduntu-desktop will i have kde 4 or 3.5?
2008-03-03T02:55:00.000Z	zugu		well, I don't want to end up with kde 4
2008-03-03T02:56:00.000Z	zugu		anyway, it's been 2 years since I last tried ubuntu and I just want to say it rocks
2008-03-03T02:57:00.000Z	zugu		is there a default bittorrent client after a fresh install of 7.10 or I have to manually install it?
2008-03-03T02:58:00.000Z	danand	zugu	- there is one installed by default but you can easily add others by using the synaptics package manager
