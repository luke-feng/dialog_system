2007-07-11T12:19:00.000Z	bluebanana		is it worth learning html if there are WYSIWYG? We don't need to learn code when we are using office apps. How come we do when we make websites?
2007-07-11T12:21:00.000Z	geekkit	bluebanana	we learn XHTML, CSS, Javascript because no WYSIWYG tool is capable of correctly adhering to all of the rules of that language and how it all renders
