2010-11-05T19:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zackmax	you can use any WM / DE you can get your hands on, there is no such thing as "only" for netbooks
2010-11-05T19:52:00.000Z	zackmax	ActionParsnip	I see.. but the news is that X/Gnome are being ditched.. so I was wondering if that's only for netbooks or for desktops as well
2010-11-05T19:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zackmax	depends on needs and tastes, X can be ditched if you can do without it
2010-11-05T19:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zackmax	you can install any desktop on any type of system, the installer doesnt detect hardware and report "not running a netbook" and stop, it doesn't care
2010-11-05T19:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zackmax	some will make the netbook more responsive and such but you can run a full gnome desktop with compiz if you feel like it
