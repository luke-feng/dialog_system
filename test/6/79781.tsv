2007-09-13T06:54:00.000Z	technomom		ok....maybe not the Dell.....

2007-09-13T06:57:00.000Z	dug_	technomom	you probably already know, but hp printers seem to work well with ubuntu.  I first got a kodak one and had to return it
2007-09-13T06:59:00.000Z	dug_	technomom	are both your computers using ubuntu?  i'm not sure if ubuntu supports printer sharing
2007-09-13T07:00:00.000Z	dug_	technomom	i don't know how to share a printer in ubuntu, but it seems like there are some tutorials online: http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&hl=en&q=ubuntu+hp+printer+sharing&btnG=Google+Search
