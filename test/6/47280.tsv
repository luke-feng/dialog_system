2010-02-11T04:21:00.000Z	Goliath		vlc wont show correctly my greek subs (i choose greek/auto encoding) but smplayer will. any ideas?
2010-02-11T04:21:00.000Z	blakkheim	Goliath	use s/mplayer instead?
2010-02-11T04:21:00.000Z	Goliath	blakkheim	no
2010-02-11T04:21:00.000Z	blakkheim	Goliath	vlc doesn't have the best subtitle support :/
2010-02-11T04:21:00.000Z	Goliath		maybe i should change font
2010-02-11T04:22:00.000Z	blakkheim	Goliath	can i ask why you don't want to just use the program that you already have confirmed to work?
