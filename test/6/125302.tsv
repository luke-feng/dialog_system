2007-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	Jaggz-		my latest vim is 6.4 in aptitude.. but vim is at 7.0 -- how do I know if it's just not available or if my package list is updated?
2007-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	Jaggz-		does aptitude automatically update its list?
2007-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	Jaggz-		hmm.. it doesn't really show a newer version either.. in fact, it shows 6.3 .. I must have gotten some deb packages for 6.4
2007-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	mnoir	Jaggz-	strange  - I thought 6.06 was up to vim 6.4
2007-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	mnoir	Jaggz-	oic - well don't mind me - I have 7 installed everywhere
2007-01-01T12:28:00.000Z	mnoir	Jaggz-	for which languages?
