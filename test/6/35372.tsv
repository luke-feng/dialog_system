2010-04-29T06:33:00.000Z	message144	franl	ok... what about for a server.. should i wait a few months for that?
2010-04-29T06:33:00.000Z	franl	message144	no.  Both desktop and server will get shaken down very quickly.
2010-04-29T06:35:00.000Z	message144	franl	BCS-Satori, I am looking to upgrade my server from 8.04, which so far has been extremely stable.. I am just trying to see if I should upgrade to 10.04 or not.. any suggestions?
