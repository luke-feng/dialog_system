2005-07-14T09:51:00.000Z	crouton		yes
2005-07-14T09:52:00.000Z	dbernar1	crouton	what are you trying to do with firestarter
2005-07-14T09:52:00.000Z	crouton	dbernar1	Just trying to set up policies, figure out how to stealth ports, the usual. :)
2005-07-14T09:54:00.000Z	crouton	dbernar1	Are you fairly accomplished with firestarter?
2005-07-14T09:56:00.000Z	crouton	dbernar1	Indeed.  Blocked just means it's not responding at all.
