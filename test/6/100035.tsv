2006-12-02T14:34:00.000Z	finalbeta	needshelp	you can't open the partition from the places menu? Did it ever work? Normally windows partitions get added to /etc/fstab and show up in places. But you can't write on ntfs partitions, only read from them.
2006-12-02T14:35:00.000Z	needshelp	finalbeta	well it is ntfs i don't need to write just read. but it doesn't let me even open it i was thinking cause ubuntu may not support sata drives but i wasn't sure is that my problem
2006-12-02T14:37:00.000Z	finalbeta	needshelp	ubuntu should support sata. You are running the live CD? Or you have a full installation?
2006-12-02T14:38:00.000Z	finalbeta	needshelp	ah, that explains it. On the Live DVD, no partitions are mounted by default. you will have to mount them yourself.
2006-12-02T14:40:00.000Z	finalbeta	needshelp	sudo mkdir /media/windows and then sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/windows/ -t ntfs -o nls=utf8,umask=0222 needshelp you will have to replace /dev/hda1 with the windows partition.
