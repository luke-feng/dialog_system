2010-04-14T06:14:00.000Z	igoryonya		because, in SMPlayer, when I chose audio output driver, and the movie has 5.1 channel audio, everything plays 2 channels except for alsa. in VLC, even alsa plays 2 chnnels. what's wrong, does Linux really have a such poor support of audio?

2010-04-14T06:16:00.000Z	igoryonya		scunizi: sudo samba-server-configuration (from the console, or you can create a launcher with that command)

2010-04-14T06:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	igoryonya	good idea.. hadn't thought of that.
