2009-08-29T02:00:00.000Z	rhlin99		Hello, can anyone tell me how to stop ddclient from running. It seems to be slowing my system down.
2009-08-29T02:02:00.000Z	Out_Cold	rhlin99	go to terminal, type: ps aux | grep ddclient
2009-08-29T02:03:00.000Z	Out_Cold	rhlin99	then use the first large number (PID) and type: kill -9 (PID)
2009-08-29T02:04:00.000Z	rhlin99	bucky	 how can I check it to see if it is stopped?
2009-08-29T02:05:00.000Z	Out_Cold	rhlin99	use: ps aux |grep ddclient
