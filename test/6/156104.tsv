2007-08-27T09:57:00.000Z	zeeble	Parisi	yeah, running it
2007-08-27T09:58:00.000Z	Parisi	zeeble	How do you like it, what do you have to say about it?
2007-08-27T09:59:00.000Z	zeeble	Parisi	it works fine. a little more eye candy out of the box than earlier..
2007-08-27T09:59:00.000Z	Parisi	zeeble	performance wise? Faster?
2007-08-27T10:00:00.000Z	zeeble	Parisi	it works fine. dunno about exact speeds.. mine is a fairly decent m/c with a fair bit of ram, so it works fine.
