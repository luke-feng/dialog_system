2009-01-05T01:01:00.000Z	TwoD	niklaus	try htop, it's a bit nicer IMHO. Or if you're in gnome, use gnome-system-monitor
2009-01-05T01:02:00.000Z	niklaus	TwoD	can we collect stats for that process over time
2009-01-05T01:03:00.000Z	TwoD	niklaus	I doubt that.
2009-01-05T01:04:00.000Z	niklaus	TwoD	anything you know
2009-01-05T01:06:00.000Z	TwoD	niklaus	I think you need a special tool to monitor just a single process, or perhaps find some "filtering and logging" switches in top/htop. But I have no idea really.
