2007-08-19T14:59:00.000Z	Fern		Just wondering: I'm thinking of getting Ubuntu because I've heard so much good about it. But whats the difference between this, Ubuntu, and other OS's like Windows?
2007-08-19T15:00:00.000Z	Fern		Xero: Why is that?
2007-08-19T15:01:00.000Z	Fern		Are there any good programs for Ubuntu?
