2004-12-11T16:51:00.000Z	jimro		Hello, I wonder if there are any Open Source-developers here who could be so kind to participate in a interview for a researchpaper?
2004-12-11T16:53:00.000Z	subterrific	jimro	curious, how are you focusing it on open source developers and not just any developer? how is there a difference?
2004-12-11T16:54:00.000Z	jimro	subterrific	well there is something called intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, there seems to be a difference between open and closed source :)
2004-12-11T16:56:00.000Z	subterrific	jimro	do you really think it is that black and white?
2004-12-11T16:58:00.000Z	jimro	subterrific	no, but this research is focusing on open source
2004-12-11T17:02:00.000Z	subterrific	jimro	well it sounds like a very complex topic, you've got your work cut out for you
