2009-09-19T17:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	o_portista17	no problem
2009-09-19T18:01:00.000Z	o_portista17	erUSUL	sorry about the dumb question, but i have to change all fields with "eth1" back to "eth0" ?
2009-09-19T18:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	o_portista17	probably. check the MAC of your wifi and see what of the rules apply to it. change that to eth0 then edit the others so two cards do not get the same iface name
