2012-10-03T08:05:00.000Z	theo		Some advice pls: Can I install Linux on an eee pc netbook, (atom) and how good is this?
2012-10-03T08:06:00.000Z	somsip	theo	yes you can. I have it on a 701 4G so even the lowest spec can handle it, if you don't expect too much
2012-10-03T08:07:00.000Z	theo	somsip	thnx for that. It wld hv to be faster than Windoze, surely? And in ur experience, why shld I "not expect too much"?
2012-10-03T08:08:00.000Z	somsip	theo	well it depends what model you are installing it on. Don't expect much frm unity on a 401, for example. But if you run openbox or something light on a 401, it's fine.
2012-10-03T08:08:00.000Z	theo		I was thinking og getting an Asus eee pc and intsall Linux
2012-10-03T08:08:00.000Z	somsip	theo	if you buy a newer, faster model, you should be fine on all respects. But I have no anecdotal evidence to share except on a 401
