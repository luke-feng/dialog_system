2012-07-31T21:46:00.000Z	sudo-apt-get	hwkiller-netbook	I have pretty good experience with terminal.
2012-07-31T21:47:00.000Z	sudo-apt-get	hwkiller-netbook	but I am not sure what level.
2012-07-31T21:48:00.000Z	hwkiller-netbook	sudo-apt-get	arch is a really nice system. It's one where you must tweak and tinker in order to build your system up. It's simple in its engineering. It's very low profile. If that interests you, then try it. If you want a system that works very well out of the box with minimal configuration, then choose ubuntu or its children.
