2006-05-22T10:15:00.000Z	Frogzoo	jag	I prefer esd, as it allows multiple sound sources, btw
2006-05-22T10:19:00.000Z	jag	Frogzoo	I'm not sure what to use since I'm pretty new with Linux, im trying to set up a studio... do u know anything about that kind of stuff?
2006-05-22T10:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo	jag	not sure - you'd best talk to a sound pro
2006-05-22T10:21:00.000Z	Frogzoo	jag	or just try alsa/esd & see which you like best
