2011-02-07T07:32:00.000Z	BeyondSora		hey guys
2011-02-07T07:32:00.000Z	BeyondSora		so I have virtualbox installed, and arch set up as the guest OS
2011-02-07T07:32:00.000Z	BeyondSora		now i have made my home folder shared folder with the guest OS
2011-02-07T07:32:00.000Z	BeyondSora		but at first my arch couldnt read my home folder
2011-02-07T07:32:00.000Z	BeyondSora		i realized the permission setting for the home folder is set as rwx to myself, and nothing to everyone else
