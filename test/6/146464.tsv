2006-03-06T10:31:00.000Z	daved		if i create a package with checkinstall, is there any way for me to add some dependencies to it.. i'm putting it in a custom apt repository and would like the dependencies to be auto-installed
2006-03-06T10:32:00.000Z	daved		is there a channel with people that actually know a bit more hardcore things about ubuntu/linux in general?
