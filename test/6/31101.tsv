2012-02-18T22:54:00.000Z	theadmin	archo43	Format everything :D
2012-02-18T23:01:00.000Z	theadmin	archo43	There's no "better".
2012-02-18T23:02:00.000Z	theadmin	archo43	This doesn't make much sense you know, Ubuntu's forked off Debian sort of, so the code is same a lot. Ubuntu's more up-to-date most of the time though, although has a much different software set and release system.
2012-02-18T23:06:00.000Z	theadmin	archo43	Not really...
2012-02-18T23:08:00.000Z	theadmin	archo43	This channel only offers Ubuntu support, so we can't really discuss other distrso.
