2010-10-28T11:35:00.000Z	fiber		Hey, I was wondering if there was a way to mount a drive without permissions.  Basically, I have a media hard drive (ext4) that gets mounted automatically at boot (fstab) and I don't want it to have any permissions on it so that everyone can access it regardless of who made the files.  Thanks!

2010-10-28T11:36:00.000Z	llutz_	fiber	set sgid
