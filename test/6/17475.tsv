2011-11-27T03:17:00.000Z	dark		i'm using ubuntu 11.04. how can I install the mplayer plugin for firefox? there is no mozilla-mplayer package. (also, on chromium). i'm currently using totem plugin
2011-11-27T03:19:00.000Z	glebihan	dark	I think the package for that is gecko-mediaplayer
2011-11-27T03:20:00.000Z	dark	glebihan	no chromium/webkit version?
2011-11-27T03:21:00.000Z	glebihan	dark	it's in the same package (see the package description for the list of supported browsers)
2011-11-27T03:24:00.000Z	glebihan	dark	well that documentation is community-maintained, so when you see a page that's outdated you can update it ;)
2011-11-27T03:26:00.000Z	dark	glebihan	you're right, but any user that sees this just sees it's from help.ubuntu.com (therefore seemingly official), but is also really outdated
