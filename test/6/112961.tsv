2008-01-16T20:21:00.000Z	strike		are you using an lcd bullguard4?
2008-01-16T20:22:00.000Z	strike		bullguard make sure your console res matches your x res vga=792 or something along those lines
2008-01-16T20:24:00.000Z	strike		274 sounds too low for a console resolution
2008-01-16T20:26:00.000Z	strike		i meant try 769 i think that is 640x400 about the lowest you can set
