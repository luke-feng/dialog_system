2012-05-05T05:09:00.000Z	justin_		has anyone else noticed the compiz shift switcher behaves differently in 12.04?
2012-05-05T05:11:00.000Z	justin_		then when you released ALT, it would shift focus to that window
2012-05-05T05:11:00.000Z	justin_		now, I have to press ENTER to shift the focus to that window
2012-05-05T05:12:00.000Z	justin_		yeah, just kind of annoying.  i don't understand why the change from 11.10 to 12.04
2012-05-05T05:12:00.000Z	magicJ	justin_	 still works that way for me
2012-05-05T05:13:00.000Z	justin_	magicJ	good to know, guess i should reinstall compiz ccsm and/or unity?
