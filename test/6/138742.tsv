2005-10-11T06:43:00.000Z	cevizoglu		is it hard to recover ubuntu if you installed windows **after** you installed ubuntu?
2005-10-11T06:44:00.000Z	Cashel	cevizoglu	not realy, you just need to reinstall grub
2005-10-11T06:44:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Cashel	that's what I thought
2005-10-11T06:47:00.000Z	Cashel	cevizoglu	have you already reinstalled? easier if you havent yet...
2005-10-11T06:48:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Cashel	I'm not sure yet if I want to use Windows... I'm leaving 22GB open just in case, and using it to play in the meantime  :)
