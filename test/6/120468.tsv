2011-08-18T15:59:00.000Z	ChessTeach		I am having trouble using mailutils, I installed it, and am able to send emails without errors, but nothing shows up on the other end.
2011-08-18T16:00:00.000Z	usr13_	ChessTeach	What method are you using to send emails?
2011-08-18T16:01:00.000Z	usr13_	ChessTeach	So you are using gmail's pop server?
2011-08-18T16:01:00.000Z	usr13_	ChessTeach	Or are you using the standard web-based interface gmail.google.com ?
2011-08-18T16:03:00.000Z	usr13_	ChessTeach	Are you using a mail client?  Or are you using gmail's web-based mail, (the standard/normal method)?
2011-08-18T16:04:00.000Z	usr13_	ChessTeach	Are you using gmail to send these emails?  Or not?
