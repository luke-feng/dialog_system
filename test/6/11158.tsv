2011-08-14T04:20:00.000Z	magpii		can somebody please give me the link to a stable current version of ubuntu as the one that i have installed over my windows os on my pc is seriously screwing with my calm
2011-08-14T04:21:00.000Z	magpii		it just opened up 0on its own, the dvd that was in the drive and then spammed the screen with 8 dir dialogue windows
2011-08-14T04:21:00.000Z	magpii		11.04 is the one that just wrecked 3 years of uni work and sent my calm through levels of chaos previously unrecorded
2011-08-14T04:22:00.000Z	magpii		those responsible for releasing an os into the public domian while it is still full of bugs need to be taken out the back and seriously pionted at
2011-08-14T04:24:00.000Z	magpii		forget it, its my fault for trusting in the hype, its my mistake, thanks for the help anyway
2011-08-14T04:24:00.000Z	zabomber	magpii	what would i hack if it wasn't buggy?
