2011-05-01T02:40:00.000Z	owner		hey can anyone help me. I have tried to get Blender 2.57b to work with openshot in Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04 and so far it won't work.
2011-05-01T02:41:00.000Z	owner		I'm running 11.04 too
2011-05-01T02:41:00.000Z	owner		OpenShot video editor wants Blender 2.57b installed in order for it to do the CGI stuff.
2011-05-01T02:41:00.000Z	owner		I tried going into prefrences and telling OpenShot where the new blender executable was but it won't do it.
2011-05-01T02:42:00.000Z	owner		I hate unity.
