2009-05-18T02:19:00.000Z	chnguy		oh really!
2009-05-18T02:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	chnguy	if you just reformat the windows partition, ubuntu will be safe
2009-05-18T02:34:00.000Z	lstarnes	chnguy	is that really necessary? just be patient and someone will help you eventually
2009-05-18T02:34:00.000Z	lstarnes	chnguy	also, try ##windows for windows-related issues
