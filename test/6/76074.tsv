2007-10-13T16:58:00.000Z	Gunner_Sr		hi all, Does Ubuntu 7.04 x86 support 4GB, or am I better off with AMD64?
2007-10-13T16:58:00.000Z	Gunner_Sr		sorry 4GB ram..
2007-10-13T05:02:00.000Z	Gunner_Sr		Is it worth running x86 Ubuntu of Core 2 duo with 4 GB RAM, or should I use the 64bit instead? It is going to be on a dell laptop.
2007-10-13T05:02:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gunner_Sr	64bit has some hassles involved with flashvideo, java, etc.. its doable, but to me, iits not worth the headache, so i just use 32bit, YMMV
2007-10-13T05:03:00.000Z	Gunner_Sr	IndyGunFreak	will the x86 see all my RAM (4GB)?
2007-10-13T05:03:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Gunner_Sr	honestly, i'm not sure... i don't tihnk so..
