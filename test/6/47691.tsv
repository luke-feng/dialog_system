2008-11-13T15:46:00.000Z	grep65535	|Chrizz|	ask him if his Ubuntu serial is still valid
2008-11-13T15:47:00.000Z	|Chrizz|	grep65535	LOL.
2008-11-13T16:02:00.000Z	|Chrizz|	grep65535	My friend is really believing the serial key story
2008-11-13T16:03:00.000Z	grep65535	|Chrizz|	next in line is to ask if he burned the ISO with the activation crack on it  ;-)
2008-11-13T16:05:00.000Z	grep65535	|Chrizz|	just think windows, and torture at will with these hybrid questions lol
