2008-06-06T23:45:00.000Z	Gemmie78		I'm curious to know whether most people here use Evolution or Thunderbird for their mail
2008-06-06T23:46:00.000Z	Gemmie78		I see
2008-06-06T23:46:00.000Z	amrik	Gemmie78	i use evolution on ubuntu and thunderbird on my winxp laptop they are both fine
2008-06-06T23:46:00.000Z	amrik	Gemmie78	and pine at work, and mail when im feeeling especially hardcore
2008-06-06T23:46:00.000Z	amrik	Gemmie78	the one thing i needed that thunderbird didnt have out of the box was pgp signing
2008-06-06T23:46:00.000Z	amrik	Gemmie78	but there is an extension for that so its ok
