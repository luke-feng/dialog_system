2010-11-13T03:55:00.000Z	sympt0m		wow, that didn't make a whole lot of sense
2010-11-13T03:55:00.000Z	bazhang	sympt0m	or you could make a installable iso with something like remastersys
2010-11-13T03:55:00.000Z	bazhang	sympt0m	its called remastersys
2011-04-27T14:18:00.000Z	bazhang	sympt0m	backtrack is not supported here
2011-04-27T14:18:00.000Z	bazhang	sympt0m	sure it is. #grub if you wish
