2010-10-27T04:25:00.000Z	Praxi		There was no direct download on that page I saw gasull , but I didn't look real hard, just the torrent link hehe
2010-10-27T04:26:00.000Z	gasull	Praxi	Sean93: then my advice is to install deluge  (sudo apt-get install deluge)  and use deluge with that torrent
2010-10-27T04:37:00.000Z	gasull	Praxi	OK.  Anyway I don't think he read the last thing I said b/c he left the room :)
2010-10-27T04:37:00.000Z	gasull	Praxi	Smittie3900w: yes, Sean93 might be still rebooting
