2010-01-20T15:38:00.000Z	DJones	karhu	How old is the nvidia tnt card, if its what I think, its quite an old card which might not be supported anymore, I've got an old nvidia geforce 2 which only works with the open source nv driver
2010-01-20T15:43:00.000Z	DJones	karhu	I'm not sure what to suggest, I can;t install any nvidia drivers because of the age of the card & it not being supported any longer, but the default driver does give me a resolution of 1600x1200
