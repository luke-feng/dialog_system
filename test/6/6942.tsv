2011-08-18T22:59:00.000Z	Tygre	wildbat	 grub works fine when these 'extra' drives are not powered up
2011-08-18T23:00:00.000Z	Tygre		they don't have any essential OS files on them
2011-08-18T23:00:00.000Z	Tygre		when they are on, i don't even get an option to choose an OS, just an error "no such device" followed by a long string of letters and numbers
2011-08-18T23:01:00.000Z	wildbat	Tygre	it is still possible to have grub install on the usb and you yet boot them in BIOS
2011-08-18T23:01:00.000Z	Tygre	wildbat	\I'll check real quick.
