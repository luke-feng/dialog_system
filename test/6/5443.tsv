2012-03-25T23:03:00.000Z	EvilResistance	jeremiah_	 that's the problem
2012-03-25T23:03:00.000Z	EvilResistance	jeremiah_	 you need to be using Sun Java
2012-03-25T23:03:00.000Z	EvilResistance	jeremiah_	 Minecraft doesnt work on OpenJDK
2012-03-25T23:03:00.000Z	jeremiah_	EvilResistance	oh. but it worked before i made it and icon.
2012-03-25T23:05:00.000Z	jeremiah_	EvilResistance	 so how do i install sun java? i can't find it in software center.
