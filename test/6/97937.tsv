2007-01-09T08:45:00.000Z	auTONYmous	genius314	is it a powered hub?
2007-01-09T08:46:00.000Z	genius314	auTONYmous	No. I think theres a port in the back for a power cord, but I haven't needed one so far. The new hub is 2.0, and it came with a power cord. I'm not sure if it needs it, though.
2007-01-09T08:47:00.000Z	auTONYmous	genius314	try plugging in the 2.0 hub (the power cord, that it). USB has _some_ power to all devices, but the wireless adapter may need more than the USB bus provides without an external power adapter on the hub
2007-01-09T08:49:00.000Z	genius314	auTONYmous	I've already tried combinations (with power, without, etc), and nothing works. Even if I use the same hub, but a different port on the hub, the card won't work. I'm guessing its some sort of configuration problem, not the hub itself.
2007-01-09T08:51:00.000Z	auTONYmous	genius314	Sorry, maybe someone else can help
2007-01-09T08:51:00.000Z	genius314	auTONYmous	Okay.
