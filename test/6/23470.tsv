2010-04-02T14:30:00.000Z	costre	Mkools	If you divided the free space into two new partitions, you could probably join them
2010-04-02T14:31:00.000Z	Mkools	costre	I want to install a O.S. which free space is best?
2010-04-02T14:31:00.000Z	costre	Mkools	I would choose the fastest and most reliable drive
2010-04-02T14:39:00.000Z	Mkools	costre	How to decide which is the most fastest and reliable?
