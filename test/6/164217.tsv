2004-10-13T13:02:00.000Z	rexiboy		feels like this preview shouldn't have been released
2004-10-13T13:03:00.000Z	rexiboy		looks like the ubuntu team just rushing to get something out without proper testing or documantation
2004-10-13T13:04:00.000Z	subterrific	rexiboy	have you reported a bug?
2004-10-13T13:05:00.000Z	subterrific	rexiboy	so open a bug, and help them get it fixed. that is the point of a preview release, to help them work out bugs. complaining and saying they shouldn't have released anything is worthless
2004-10-13T13:06:00.000Z	rexiboy	subterrific	i guess i'm a bit frustrated :) i will report a bug though
