2010-11-25T12:55:00.000Z	SmokeyD		Hey everyone. Maybe a bit off topic, but does anyone know of a website I can use to gather several RSS feeds and republish them as one feed, so I can use that one feed in a desktop rss reader widget (in compiz)?
2010-11-25T12:57:00.000Z	nomtv80	SmokeyD	you can code that with PHP
2010-11-25T12:58:00.000Z	SmokeyD	nomtv80	yeah, I can also code my own rss reader, but I was hoping there would be an existing site to do it. An online rss reader that republishes all feeds into one new feed or something. Google reader doesn't seem to be able to do that
