2005-04-27T09:11:00.000Z	aliasd		i got a couple of questions
2005-04-27T09:11:00.000Z	aliasd		1. is the root password randomised, changed periodically?
2005-04-27T09:11:00.000Z	aliasd		the password is nothing?
2005-04-27T09:12:00.000Z	aliasd		umm... there has to be a root password, weather or not anyone knows it :)
2005-04-27T09:13:00.000Z	NigelS	aliasd	no, there doesn't :P the root account is disabled
