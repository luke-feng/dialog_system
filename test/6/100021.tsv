2007-10-20T01:54:00.000Z	Tominator	bofh80	what du you mean?
2007-10-20T01:55:00.000Z	Tominator	bofh80	are you looking for software which is able to use your special keys?
2007-10-20T01:56:00.000Z	bofh80	Tominator	no i hate those things. but we can't be sure until we find out what in ubuntu is launching the applications. something HAS to be controlling it, it's already installed and running, we just need to find it's config
