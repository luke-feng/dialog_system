2007-09-15T14:39:00.000Z	kringel	lowlux	or when nothing is working anymore <Alt>+<Print>+S (syncing... wait) <Alt>+<Print>+U (mounting filesystem read-only... wait!) then <Alt>+<Print>+B (reboot immediately). Before you should try in a non-graphical terminal (when system doesn react anymore) <Strg>+<Alt>+<Entf> This is more the smooth way
