2008-10-19T02:28:00.000Z	Ean		Hi all! How can I show the 'time' in terminal? Google just gave me nothing... :P
2008-10-19T02:28:00.000Z	cookieofdoom	Ean	uptime should tell you what time it is.
2008-10-19T02:30:00.000Z	Ean	cookieofdoom	Thanks, ush 13h uptime. better go to sleep and take a walk tomorrow O.o'
2008-10-19T02:32:00.000Z	Ean	cookieofdoom	Btw, when I wrote uptime I saw that I had 2 users, 2 with the same name. I sthat normal?
2008-10-19T02:33:00.000Z	cookieofdoom	Ean	I see that, too. I honestly don't know why that's there. One might be the root login for GDM?
2008-10-19T02:34:00.000Z	Ean	cookieofdoom	Ok, might be. Just got curious. :P Anyway, thanks again.
