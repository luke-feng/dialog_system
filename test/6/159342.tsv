2011-12-30T07:17:00.000Z	justice		The screen shows "no signal" and turns off.
2011-12-30T07:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	justice	 at the grub menu you dont see anything?
2011-12-30T07:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	justice	 grub has a option to use a 'text' mode or lower res settings. that ive had to use on some machines.
2011-12-30T07:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	justice	 but grub would still work.. you just couldent see it.
2011-12-30T07:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	justice	 i got grub to play a little tune from its config file so im sure grub loaded. :)
