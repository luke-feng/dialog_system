2005-06-07T15:22:00.000Z	dooglus	dbernar1_	sorry?  what do you mean?
2005-06-07T15:22:00.000Z	dbernar1_	dooglus	REBELinBLUE: it cuts both ways:  in linux you can almost always get to the source code to fix it for yourself if you want to
2005-06-07T15:22:00.000Z	dbernar1_	dooglus	REBELinBLUE: but in Windows, there are so many people using it, that most of the things that need fixing have been fixed already....
2005-06-07T15:24:00.000Z	dbernar1_	dooglus	that is what I meant by stupid sentence....completely not true.
2005-06-07T15:26:00.000Z	dooglus	dbernar1_	I'm not sure, but I don't think my sentence was untrue.  Windows has more users than Linux.  And Windows is compatible with more hardware than Linux.  You wouldn't disagree with either of those 2 sentences I trust?
