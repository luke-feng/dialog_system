2009-11-13T05:37:00.000Z	upd_		nautilus sux
2009-11-13T05:37:00.000Z	deserteagle	upd_	agreed :P
2009-11-13T05:38:00.000Z	deserteagle	upd_	rox, thunar, etc.
2009-11-13T05:39:00.000Z	deserteagle	upd_	thunar still has a lot of the functionality of nautilus (if you prefer that stuff)
2009-11-13T05:39:00.000Z	deserteagle	upd_	rox on the other hand is more bare bones and tweak friendly :D
