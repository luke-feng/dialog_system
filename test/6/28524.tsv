2009-11-05T01:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ascaronth	Do you have an intel graphics card?
2009-11-05T01:20:00.000Z	Ascaronth	Jordan_U	I have an intel chipset... 865G if I remember correctly
2009-11-05T01:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ascaronth	Are you running 9.10?
2009-11-05T01:22:00.000Z	Ascaronth	Jordan_U	Yes i am and i havent installed flash yet, but on 9.04 it was really slow
2009-11-05T01:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Ascaronth	No, and flash performace should be3 better in 9.10, particularly full screen
