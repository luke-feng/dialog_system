2010-10-06T10:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dstryr	putty
2010-10-06T10:53:00.000Z	dstryr	prince_jammys	are you familiar with it?
2010-10-06T10:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dstryr	you may get more informed answers at ##windows, since who's serving doesn't matter. putty is probably the most popular.
2010-10-06T11:16:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dstryr	no, some clients like filezilla are gui.
2010-10-06T11:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	dstryr	that also links to a page on keys.
