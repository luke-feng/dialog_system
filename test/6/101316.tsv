2008-09-30T18:24:00.000Z	Slart	Glady	could be a million reasons.. you've not exactly given us a lot to work with.. my bet is on the site being swallowed by a hole in the ground.. might be because your monitor isn't turned on too.. hard to tell
2008-09-30T18:26:00.000Z	Slart	Glady	some examples of things you could tell us: format of the video, url to the video, error messages either from running opera in terminal or from the syslog or similar, do other videos play fine etc etc.. I'm sure you can think of more things to check
