2012-10-23T07:00:00.000Z	Radikal08		Help! I am trying to install aircrack-ng, because I have obviously forgot my password for my router................................... I getn an error message saying something about iw:i386, so I found a link from googel to download the *.deb version, and it starts up Ubuntu Software Centre to download aircrack-ng, but i get the same error message "cannot install "iw:i386". Anyone know why?
