2010-06-27T00:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hareldvd	  I think ive seen it done with some tools that have a 'delay setting' that can wait a few sec then take a snap shot.  but i cant recall the name of the tools.
2010-07-14T23:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hareldvd	 depends on how far down the list windows is.. Or you can use the 'saved' feature of grub2 and select windows  by 'name'

2010-07-14T23:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hareldvd	 look at where it mentions --> GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
