2007-08-21T08:16:00.000Z	Wormy		Alright. Althought I can't find the little thing, I found a tiny computer that isn't quite a palm pilot, not quite a laptop. Runs Windows CE, has a flash drive, appears to be from 1998. I want to try to get Xbuntu running on it. Anyone know how big an Xbuntu install is? I just need to know what size drive to buy for it
2007-08-21T08:17:00.000Z	Pici	Wormy	What architecture is the device?
2007-08-21T08:19:00.000Z	Pici	Wormy	You'll probably get a faster answer in #xubuntu
2007-08-21T08:37:00.000Z	Wormy	Pici	I don't think there's anyone awake in the xubuntu channel
2007-08-21T08:37:00.000Z	Pici	Wormy	Try asking here again.
2007-08-21T08:50:00.000Z	Pici	Wormy	Yes, that would be the best thing to do.
