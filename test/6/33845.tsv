2009-11-22T01:24:00.000Z	Ihavequestions		Would anyone have a moment to answer some basic questions about Ubuntu installation? I was wondering if i could install it but keep windows on there as a backup in case I don't like it?
2009-11-22T01:26:00.000Z	Ihavequestions		o ok.  i have vista currently, hate it, heard windows 7 was better, but have been told that Linux based systems are much safer
2009-11-22T01:27:00.000Z	LordVorp	Ihavequestions	everybody hates vista.  linux systems are "safer" only in that "everybody runs windows" so virus/spyware writers concentrate on that
2009-11-22T01:28:00.000Z	LordVorp	Ihavequestions	also linux has a superior security model so that "making an exception for one program" does NOT automatically mean you've opened UR system at admin level
2009-11-22T01:28:00.000Z	LordVorp	Ihavequestions	macs (as of OSX) are based on a different unix-y system (NetBSD I believe), and so share the benefits that linux has WRT security
