2010-10-28T19:59:00.000Z	jpds	delinquentme	I believe that they're real RAID, reliable or not stands to question.
2010-10-28T19:59:00.000Z	delinquentme	jpds	ehhh really?!
2011-02-15T22:38:00.000Z	jpds	delinquentme	Because it's just a front-end for the 'locate' terminal command?
2011-02-15T22:38:00.000Z	delinquentme	jpds	?
2011-02-15T22:39:00.000Z	jpds	delinquentme	I think it does, sorry.
