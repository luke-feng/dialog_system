2010-09-18T06:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding	younder	i think you need to have execute permissions on every directory along the path to that directory

2010-09-18T06:14:00.000Z	tensorpudding	younder	that S really is capitalized there?
2010-09-18T06:16:00.000Z	younder	tensorpudding	It is capitalized if there is no x
