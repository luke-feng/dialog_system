2007-05-16T12:30:00.000Z	ompaul	Molluck	you should get three live CDs with 2.6 kernels and try them - bet they all lock up - it is your ram - or we would have hundreds complaining like you are - I have had bad ram before and your telling me exactly what I have seen with bad ram
2007-05-16T12:32:00.000Z	Molluck	ompaul	allright. kind of limited with this laptop, but i will consider that :)
2007-05-16T13:05:00.000Z	ompaul	Molluck	you reboot and use it with no other software running and leave it as long as you want
2007-05-16T13:05:00.000Z	ompaul	Molluck	but it does not catch 100% which is why I said 3 live cds
2007-05-16T13:05:00.000Z	Molluck	ompaul	that doesn't answer my question. i want to know how many tests there are. I'm on test #7.
