2006-07-31T07:33:00.000Z	micahcowan	dmsantam	don't knock it. Even if, educationally, it's worth it, it can actually get jobs (I don't have it, don't plan to).
2006-07-31T07:33:00.000Z	micahcowan		*educationally, it's not worth it, ...
2006-07-31T07:34:00.000Z	dmsantam	micahcowan	possibly. i don't know whether it still gets jobs.
2006-07-31T07:34:00.000Z	dmsantam	micahcowan	but yes, its certainly educationally pointless :)
2006-07-31T07:34:00.000Z	micahcowan	dmsantam	it may not as much as it used to... but I believe it does, in some circles.
