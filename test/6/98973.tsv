2006-12-16T10:22:00.000Z	caminomaster		I have an important question: I've heard that is easy to "override" root password, then it makes me fear
2006-12-16T10:22:00.000Z	ppj	caminomaster	if you have physical access its easy as hell.
2006-12-16T10:23:00.000Z	ppj	caminomaster	you just single user it and pswd root
2006-12-16T10:23:00.000Z	caminomaster	ppj	there's no way to avoid it?
2006-12-16T10:23:00.000Z	ppj	caminomaster	where is the server?
2006-12-16T10:28:00.000Z	caminomaster	ppj	my pc is at home, and the potential "enemy" too
