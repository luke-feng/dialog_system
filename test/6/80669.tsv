2008-05-03T10:53:00.000Z	chuy_max	javaTN	did you follow the wiki ubotu told you?, you can read mount it using this: sudo mount -o uid=your_user /dev/hda1 /mountpoint/
2008-05-03T10:54:00.000Z	chuy_max	javaTN	that uses the kernel driver and youll be able to read without problems, ntfs3g is safer, you should check the wiki
2008-05-03T10:54:00.000Z	chuy_max	javaTN	its ubottu someone changed the name, it is the bot
2008-05-03T10:56:00.000Z	chuy_max	javaTN	well, then follow the instructions there, you have 2 choices
