2006-09-12T05:19:00.000Z	loveubuntu		why does ubuntu not have xchat anymore in default install???
2006-09-12T05:20:00.000Z	loveubuntu		but it shouldve been there default:)
2006-09-12T05:22:00.000Z	loveubuntu		i think totem-gstreamer should be replaced with totem-xine............totem-gstreamer doesnt even play unencrypted dvds....although Help says that it does

2006-09-12T05:23:00.000Z	loveubuntu	rasputnik	but toem-xine will do better job
2006-09-12T05:25:00.000Z	rasputnik	loveubuntu	yup mplayer is the daddy of all media players.
