2007-02-02T07:00:00.000Z	Ricket		Another question: how do I make Ubuntu's keyboard shortcuts manager recognize special keyboard keys? (I'm using a multimedia keyboard, with a log off button, and i want it to lock screen on press...)

2007-02-02T07:01:00.000Z	Cryoniq	Ricket	under gnome that is
2007-02-02T07:02:00.000Z	Cryoniq	Ricket	there was a ton of keyboards listed in there to choose from when I looked at it last time. It didnt have Logitech G15 for me though, but I choose another multimedia logitech and super key etc started working for me then :)
