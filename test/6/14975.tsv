2011-01-12T16:17:00.000Z	dshbusiness		Hello, I have a small question.
2011-01-12T16:17:00.000Z	dshbusiness		I use gnome desktop environment. When I click "Places" on my top panel, I will see "Recent Documents"
2011-01-12T16:17:00.000Z	dshbusiness		But I find this feature useless. Except for others who want to see what files I have opened recently.
2011-01-12T16:17:00.000Z	dshbusiness		How can I shutdown this feature?
