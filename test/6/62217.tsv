2008-03-20T04:59:00.000Z	anteaya		i am looking at my user.log file for the first time and it seems to me that when i sudo, i am not dropping back down to regular user status but staying as root.  Is there a way to confirm this?

2008-03-20T05:00:00.000Z	anteaya	Pelo	can i execute a command to force a drop?
2008-03-20T05:01:00.000Z	Pelo	anteaya	probably,  try man sudo , there should be options to let you do that in there
