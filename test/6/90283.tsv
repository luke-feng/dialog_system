2007-04-13T08:42:00.000Z	Rio79	xtknight	wastrel> "-R" only effects the child directories, right? it doesnt go up through the parent directories?
2007-04-13T08:43:00.000Z	xtknight	Rio79	no it does not traverse the parents.  only the hcildren

2007-04-17T09:22:00.000Z	xtknight	Rio79	mplayer can switch between audio streams.  youll have to read the manual for that one though.  'man mplayer'.  VideoLAN client (VLC) may be able to also via GUI
