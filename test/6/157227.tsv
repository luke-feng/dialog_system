2007-05-04T08:40:00.000Z	wastrel	timewriter	 apt-cache search gtk-engines
2007-05-04T08:40:00.000Z	wastrel	timewriter	 if the one you want is listed, just install normally
2007-05-04T08:44:00.000Z	wastrel	timewriter	 it appears that ubuntu doesn't provide a package for the aurora engine
2007-05-04T08:44:00.000Z	wastrel	timewriter	 you'll probably have to download the aurora engine and compile it yourself
2007-05-04T08:49:00.000Z	wastrel	timewriter	 up to you :]
