2009-08-13T22:04:00.000Z	unperson		I just got a new computer, and I want to test stability under load.  Any suggestions for programs I can quickly apt-get install that will provide a good test (use up a lot of CPU and RAM)?
2009-08-13T22:05:00.000Z	Kelder	unperson	only one i know is hardinfo (sudo apt-get install hardinfo) i believe it has some tests in there
2009-08-13T22:05:00.000Z	Kelder	unperson	(hwinfo is the cli version, hardinfo the gui one)
2009-08-13T22:11:00.000Z	unperson	Kelder	Halitech, Winkie:  Thanks for the suggestions.  What about distributed computing tasks (protein folding, etc.)?  I guess maybe they're not apt-getable.

2009-08-13T22:14:00.000Z	unperson	Kelder	Well I don't need to benchmark so much as I want to stress test.  I actually thought maybe I should just start compiling the kernel or something.  Anyway, I appreciate your input.
