2006-11-29T14:29:00.000Z	Fobia		Hello guys
2006-11-29T14:30:00.000Z	Fobia		I've downloaded Ubuntu from ubuntu.com (desktop version) and I've burn it on a CD... made my PC boot from that PC and it doesnt... how can I install it ?
2006-11-29T14:31:00.000Z	LjL	Fobia	have you ever booted from CDs on that computer before?
2006-11-29T14:32:00.000Z	LjL	Fobia	have you verified the CD?
2006-11-29T14:33:00.000Z	LjL	Fobia	well, for some reason, my CD drive is a bit lunatic with booting from CDs i burn (including the Ubuntu CD). sometimes i've had to try up to 10 times or so before i could get it to boot... perhaps you're having a similar problem
2006-11-29T14:33:00.000Z	LjL	Fobia	does your computer completely ignore the presence of the CD (i.e. just goes on booting Windows), or does it try and fail?
