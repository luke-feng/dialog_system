2006-12-14T07:21:00.000Z	itsmabus		Why does my computer stop responding when I remove the keyboard?
2006-12-14T07:22:00.000Z	itsmabus		ie: it can't be pinged when the keyboard comes out
2006-12-14T07:22:00.000Z	rapid	itsmabus	thats wierd.
2006-12-14T07:23:00.000Z	itsmabus	rapid	Yeah, I have 4 servers like this sitting here... 1 working keyboard.
2006-12-14T07:43:00.000Z	itsmabus	rapid	and now, even with a kvm switch... switching from one computer to the other with the scroll lock X2, up key combo freezes BOTH machines
