2010-04-10T18:47:00.000Z	dancallo		I installed Ubuntu Netbook Remix - 9.10 on my Acer Netbook and now I can't connect to UbuntuOne. There is a red X on this icon.
2010-04-10T18:47:00.000Z	dancallo		Any ideas?
2010-04-10T18:48:00.000Z	dancallo		Yes, of course I do.
2010-04-10T18:50:00.000Z	dancallo		Can someone help me with my UbuntuOne issue?
2010-04-10T18:51:00.000Z	dancallo		I can't seem to connect to it.
