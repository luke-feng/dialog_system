2010-12-20T00:05:00.000Z	sam-_-_	hylian	the opensource driver is fine. it doesn't provide full 3d accel yet but other than that...
2010-12-20T00:07:00.000Z	sam-_-_	hylian	ok. but the situation is constantly improving imho :-)
2010-12-20T00:08:00.000Z	hylian	sam-_-_	you are right, it is, which is why i said yet. the open source driver for fglrx is gonna be awesome, it's just gonna take some time.
