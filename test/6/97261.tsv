2007-07-17T11:31:00.000Z	elpargo		hi I'm using df on my disk and it's missing a couple of GBs
2007-07-17T11:31:00.000Z	elpargo		is there a more acurate tool?
2007-07-17T11:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	elpargo	Did you factor in the space taken by the file system itself?
2007-07-17T11:34:00.000Z	elpargo	Jordan_U	don't think ext3 takes 2GB and I believe cfdisk does.
