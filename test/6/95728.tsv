2009-10-31T01:53:00.000Z	Bilz		i want to install an operating system from a .iso file, and im using ubuntu (new to both VMWare and Ubuntu)
2009-10-31T01:53:00.000Z	Bilz		specifically when it says whether I want a virtual drive or i want access to the cd drive in the options to set up the virtual machine. im unable to browse for the iso file
2009-10-31T01:53:00.000Z	mage__	Bilz	supporting vmware is way out of the scope of this channel
2009-10-31T01:53:00.000Z	mage__	Bilz	virtualbox is easier and theres a channel on freenode
2009-10-31T01:54:00.000Z	Bilz	Voldenet	after spending all that time installing it! is virtualbox better though?
2009-10-31T01:54:00.000Z	mage__	Bilz	for virtualization use whatever you're comfortable
