2009-03-05T15:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	darXbuntu	so what if its not "as popular" as redhat
2009-03-05T15:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	darXbuntu	doesnt make it any better or worse
2009-03-05T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	darXbuntu	linux wasnt this popular, say 10 years ago but it was still there and was still used by users

2009-03-05T15:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	darXbuntu	sometimes all OSes crash
