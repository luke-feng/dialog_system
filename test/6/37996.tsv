2010-08-24T00:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	xiong	screen is one.. there are also cli based file managers.
2010-08-24T00:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	xiong	nano for text editing.. mutt for email .. elinks, w3m and others for browing the net
2010-08-24T00:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	xiong	np :) .. once you get use to it screen is invaluable.  It saves opening several tty's

2010-08-24T01:57:00.000Z	xiong	Scunizi	You had the exactly right idea. I've been trying out various "orthodox file managers" for the last couple hours. I don't know if any is everything I want but many are a big step forward.
