2011-02-21T19:30:00.000Z	alienkid10		nm-applet is now running but no icon
2011-02-21T19:31:00.000Z	IdleOne	alienkid10	right click on the panel and add Indicator Applet, that should put it back on the panel.

2011-02-21T19:33:00.000Z	alienkid10		I'll try relogging in. Then I've got another odd issue be back in a sec
2011-02-21T19:33:00.000Z	IdleOne	alienkid10	err NetworkManager Applet
