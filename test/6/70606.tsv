2007-12-15T10:31:00.000Z	pingu		toddedm2: are you sure
2007-12-15T10:31:00.000Z	p_quarles	pingu	no, it depends entirely on how well your card is supported
2007-12-15T10:32:00.000Z	p_quarles	pingu	not on the computer as a whole, just the wireless card
2007-12-15T10:32:00.000Z	p_quarles	pingu	what card do you have?
2007-12-15T10:33:00.000Z	p_quarles	pingu	well, yeah, but what's the make and model?
