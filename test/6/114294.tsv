2010-02-10T19:37:00.000Z	h2o0		I've a Core 2 Duo with 4GB of RAM, which version of Ubuntu can be better? Ubuntu 32-bit, Ubuntu 32-bit with PAE or Ubuntu 64-bit?
2010-02-10T19:37:00.000Z	jrib	h2o0	64
2010-02-10T19:38:00.000Z	jrib	h2o0	why would you?
2010-02-10T19:39:00.000Z	jrib	h2o0	you compiled it?
2010-02-10T19:42:00.000Z	jrib	h2o0	there's really no reason to avoid 64bit anymore... hasn't been for a while
