2009-11-06T06:11:00.000Z	mouseclone	Portunus	http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/MySQL_Internals_File_Formats
2009-11-06T06:11:00.000Z	Portunus	mouseclone	so the file extension should be .myd ?
2009-11-06T06:13:00.000Z	mouseclone	Portunus	looks like it could be a few things. some might be exportable formats
