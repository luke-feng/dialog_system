2010-09-05T12:24:00.000Z	headkase314	F|END	you mean the *recalled* toshiba laptops? ;)  Send it back before it catches on fire!

2010-09-05T12:34:00.000Z	headkase314	F|END	what overheating problem are you having?
2010-09-05T12:35:00.000Z	headkase314	F|END	that sounds like power management.  Windows may be idling the processor and Ubuntu may not.  I don't know, see what others say too.
2010-09-05T12:37:00.000Z	headkase314	F|END	I honestly have no idea.   I don't have experience with Wubi.
