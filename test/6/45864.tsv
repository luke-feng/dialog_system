2008-12-11T20:14:00.000Z	mib_a8eme5		How do you make Ubuntu suck less?
2008-12-11T20:14:00.000Z	rjune	mib_a8eme5	be more specific about your problems.
2008-12-11T20:14:00.000Z	rjune		random ranting will get you nowhere
2008-12-11T20:15:00.000Z	mib_a8eme5	rjune	that is if you ignore that ranting in and of itself doesn't make someone feel better.
2008-12-11T20:15:00.000Z	rjune	mib_a8eme5	I do. ranting may feel better temporarily, but does nothing to solve the underlying problem.
