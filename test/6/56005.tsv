2008-06-12T22:23:00.000Z	rockstar		I just rebooted my machine, and now, the Gnome panel with my application menu isn't showing up anymore.  Anyone have a clue why?
2008-06-12T22:23:00.000Z	unavailable	rockstar	 try right click "add to panel"
2008-06-12T22:24:00.000Z	rockstar	unavailable	no, that whole panel isn't showing up...
2008-06-12T22:25:00.000Z	unavailable	rockstar	is the other one there?
2008-06-12T22:26:00.000Z	rockstar	unavailable	how do I add a new one?  I don't see an option?
2008-06-12T22:58:00.000Z	unavailable	rockstar	right click on the one thats there (if you have the bottom one still) and select add new panel
