2012-11-18T17:27:00.000Z	bekks	midhuno	"cant install" is just too generic.
2012-11-18T17:28:00.000Z	midhuno	bekks	: blank screen after booting...... but 12.04 runs well except 3d support
2012-11-18T17:31:00.000Z	midhuno	bekks	help me
2012-11-18T17:32:00.000Z	bekks	midhuno	I cant help you, since I dont have a D270 and I dont have ATI at all.
