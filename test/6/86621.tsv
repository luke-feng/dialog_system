2009-07-12T01:16:00.000Z	iamalion		ok, so last night i installed a couple theme packages. a few mins after that, ubuntu froze.  I rebooted and it keeps freezing....    So today I went through recoverey, and all that stuff, but it still freezes.  if i open a window that has multiple secions, if i click in one, it traps my mouse and wont let me click on anything else, whether in the program window or the panels... i end up having to alt+f4 the program to regain mouse....
2009-07-12T01:16:00.000Z	iamalion		any ideas?   I removed the packages that i installed last night
