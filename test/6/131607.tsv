2007-01-21T07:06:00.000Z	pramz	slipstream3d	yes, but there are equivalent linux versions of those type of games
2007-01-21T07:08:00.000Z	slipstream3d		wow, 39mb... i haven't had that little free space since like, 1994
2007-01-21T07:08:00.000Z	slipstream3d		peter_g: it sounds like he's talking about software rendering, which is ugly and slow
2007-01-21T07:09:00.000Z	slipstream3d		and hardly any games support it anymore (they'll usually just crash)
2007-01-21T07:09:00.000Z	pramz	slipstream3d	heh talking about software rendering, i remember the voxel engine by novalogic in the mid 90s, amazing effects for a software renderer
