2011-05-30T10:16:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	LAcan	do you mean sources for which you don't have keys
2011-05-30T10:17:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	LAcan	if so I'm not sure off the top of my head
2011-05-30T10:17:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	LAcan	try just installing with apt-get on the cli
2011-05-30T10:18:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	LAcan	seems like you get more options that way as far as bypassing keys
