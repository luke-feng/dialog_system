2008-03-17T04:16:00.000Z	soundray	Fryguy--	please be tolerant
2008-03-17T04:17:00.000Z	Fryguy--	soundray	why? I spend a few hours a week in here helping people with the most ridiculous of problems, including lack of spelling and common sense? I'm not allowed to rant every now and then that I don't get more opportunities to help people with true technical problems?
2008-03-17T04:18:00.000Z	soundray	Fryguy--	I made a suggestion and I said please. Take it or leave it, and do what you want.
2008-03-17T04:18:00.000Z	Fryguy--	soundray	and I did what I wanted, which was respond to you...
