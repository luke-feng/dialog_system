2007-06-29T08:02:00.000Z	PurpZeY	ponicg	There is a way to change the keyboard layout...System--> Admin I think
2007-06-29T08:03:00.000Z	ponicg	PurpZeY	Yeah - it doesn't work though. I had to manually edit my xorg.conf to add the superkey --> windows key mapping on this thinkpad t60p
2007-06-29T08:03:00.000Z	PurpZeY	ponicg	Then I don't know.
2007-06-29T08:03:00.000Z	ponicg	PurpZeY	Thanks anyway.
