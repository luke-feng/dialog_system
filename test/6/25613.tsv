2010-10-15T01:49:00.000Z	qwertyjustin		any ideas?
2010-10-15T01:50:00.000Z	acicula	qwertyjustin	slower via wubi
2010-10-15T01:50:00.000Z	qwertyjustin	acicula	yeah i thought so, why is that? is it just slower to load up, but otherwise just as fast to actually run?

2010-10-15T01:52:00.000Z	acicula	qwertyjustin	at least i assume thats how it works
