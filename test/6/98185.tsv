2009-02-03T01:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GeffIsLegend	having windows doesn't matter, youc an still intall from a CD.
2009-02-03T01:24:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GeffIsLegend	700 should be enough.. but if you have no blank CDs, can your PC boot a thumb drive, and do you have a 1gig thumb drive available?
2009-02-03T01:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GeffIsLegend	well, i would definitely make sure you have a backup.. but how I did it, i partitioned my drive into two different drives.. moved all data to the blank partition, then installed Ubuntu to the partition that had windows (assuming you don't intend to dual boot)
2009-02-03T01:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GeffIsLegend	thats really the best thing to do.. if there's any doubt at all.
2009-02-07T18:10:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	GeffIsLegend	so choose "view hidden directories".. but you can create a link to it in your games menu pretty easily
