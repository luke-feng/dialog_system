2011-01-31T02:07:00.000Z	gbear14275		hey guys, I'm having problems burning cd-rs.  I've been troubleshooting this problem for a while now but have only nailed it down to something with this machine/software.
2011-01-31T02:08:00.000Z	gbear14275		working on a T61 with 10.10 running.  CD-r's wont be recognized when I put them in and if they are and start burning almost immidiately fail and are coasters.  The cd-r's work fine in my gf's windows machine
2011-01-31T02:08:00.000Z	gbear14275		can anyone perhaps help me try and spot any mis configurations or anything?
2011-01-31T02:10:00.000Z	gbear14275		do drive's use two different lasers for burning cd's vs dvd's?
2011-01-31T02:12:00.000Z	wooter	gbear14275	same laser, different focus
2011-01-31T02:23:00.000Z	gbear14275	wooter	is there anyway the lens that focuses could be the problem?
