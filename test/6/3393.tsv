2012-03-07T02:43:00.000Z	junctions		Quick question: How do you upgrade a xubuntu Karmic Koala (9.10, no longer supported) with a bootable USB alternate drive for 11.10?
2012-03-07T02:43:00.000Z	junctions		 (I want to upgrade, not do a fresh install)
2012-03-07T02:44:00.000Z	junctions		In the software sources it has "Add CD-ROM" which doesn't prompt me for USB information (computer has no optical drive unit)
2012-03-07T02:45:00.000Z	junctions		wow! thanks for the flood of help! I'll follow ubottu's link, and thanks for pointing me to doing sequential upgrades. luckily I'm only one step inside EOL, so the others should be a breeze
