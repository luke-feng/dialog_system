2007-04-20T06:17:00.000Z	ikonia_	yag4mi	you don't have to use beryl
2007-04-20T06:17:00.000Z	ikonia_	yag4mi	fesity is nothing to do with your card being too old to run new software
2007-04-20T06:18:00.000Z	ikonia_	yag4mi	I'd advise against it
2007-04-20T06:19:00.000Z	ikonia_	yag4mi	try the nvidia-legacy package
2007-04-20T06:19:00.000Z	ikonia_	yag4mi	it will run, but how well is debatable
