2008-02-08T01:53:00.000Z	joshua64	Gnea	i looked there, but the ML110 G5 isn't listed.  The G4 is but that's a different set of hardware
2008-02-08T01:55:00.000Z	Gnea	joshua64	the ML350 G5 is
2008-02-08T01:56:00.000Z	joshua64	Gnea	but that's ML350 not ML110
2008-02-08T01:56:00.000Z	Gnea	joshua64	based on the specs page, though, i'd bet $500 that it'll work.
