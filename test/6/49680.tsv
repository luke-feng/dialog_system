2009-02-27T02:19:00.000Z	boingboing	Flare183	I have installed the ubuntu 8.04 OS on the sda2 drive and the bootloader on a FAT32 1GB usb pen in order to not sobstitute the original vista bootloader. I tried to load from usb pen but it says: GRUB
2009-02-27T02:20:00.000Z	boingboing	Flare183	the usb pen is sdb and the partition of the hdd where ubuntu is "/" sda2
2009-02-27T02:21:00.000Z	Flare183	boingboing	GRUB is the boot manager
2009-02-27T02:22:00.000Z	boingboing	Flare183	yes i know...so how can i edit the grub on my sdb in order to boot my sda2 ?
