2008-03-12T05:48:00.000Z	genii	needhelp	Remember this is only our best guess to the issue. Try with a known good power supply if possible before buying a new one

2009-01-03T07:42:00.000Z	needhelp	genii	is ubottu available for others to use
2009-01-03T07:42:00.000Z	genii	needhelp	Yes, do:  /msg ubottu Hi                      then you can talk to him. Or visit the tab he's in now
