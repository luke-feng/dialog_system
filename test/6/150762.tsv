2005-04-21T15:12:00.000Z	daven	Jishi	ubuntu is more of a desktop o/s, as far as i can see.  for your server, have you considered using debian?
2005-04-21T15:12:00.000Z	daven	Jishi	this installs quite happily without the gui
2005-04-21T15:12:00.000Z	daven	Jishi	and without openoffice, evolution, etc, etc
2005-04-21T15:12:00.000Z	daven	Jishi	and you can still use apt-get, and aptitude to install
2005-04-21T15:14:00.000Z	Jishi	daven	thank yoiu for the advice...I wanted to install ubuntu because I felt really compfy with it... and learned alot about tlinux from it.... But I guess debian will have similare command right?
