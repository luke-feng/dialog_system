2009-02-08T10:08:00.000Z	Kokloco		I noticed that OpenOffice has been released in version 3.0. The one I have installed is 2.4, and the Update Manager doesnt tell me anything about it, anyone can help me please?
2009-02-08T10:09:00.000Z	Kokloco		In UButu reposteries I just can find the 2.4, is there any reaso for this?
2009-02-08T10:09:00.000Z	nickrud	Kokloco	it should be in the next release; an ubuntu release's packages are 'frozen' on release, and only replaced for major bug reasons
2009-02-08T10:11:00.000Z	Kokloco	nickrud	and when is the new realease comming?
2009-02-08T10:11:00.000Z	Kokloco	nickrud	ok thanks
