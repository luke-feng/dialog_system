2009-12-18T09:51:00.000Z	tmbg		sound for adobe flash is only coming out of my secondary soundcard (onboard). every mixer I have is configured to use the addon card (sb live 5.1) as primary. using 9.10, flashplugin-installer 10.0.42.34ubuntu0.9.10.1, firefox 3.5.5 ... how do you set the primary audio output for flash? (privmsg or use 'tmbg' to get my attention if you have an answer please)
