2006-12-09T08:46:00.000Z	eimajenthat		Hello, having a strange occurrence with my Edgy Eft box.  I have a 60GB root partition (58 might be closer, but you get the idea.)  df and a couple other things tell me the partition is full, but I go to '/' in Nautilus and show hidden files, and highlight everything in there, then click Properties, and it all adds up to about 34GB.  Where's the rest?
2006-12-09T08:47:00.000Z	psusi	eimajenthat	there are probably parts that you don't have permission to see
2006-12-09T08:48:00.000Z	eimajenthat	psusi	ah yeah, I guess that makes sense.  'Nother question.  How can I search for files above a certain size?
2006-12-09T08:51:00.000Z	eimajenthat	psusi	I opened Nautilus as root, and I still only have 34GB worth of stuff
2006-12-09T08:51:00.000Z	psusi	eimajenthat	hrm.... odd....
2006-12-09T08:52:00.000Z	eimajenthat	psusi	glad I'm not the only one that thinks so
