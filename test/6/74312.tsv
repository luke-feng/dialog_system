2008-01-06T20:36:00.000Z	Strangework		My computer has a tendency to hang at random moments without reason, when this happens, I can still control my mouse, but my keyboard will not respond, neither will any open windows. The only way to get out of this is to remove the power to my laptop. What can I do about this? Are there any error logs that I must provide?
