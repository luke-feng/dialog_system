2008-02-25T03:21:00.000Z	Pelo	Hal9000	restricted drivers might also be an issue
2008-02-25T03:21:00.000Z	Hal9000	Pelo	im using restricted drivers for wlan and graphics
2008-02-25T03:22:00.000Z	Pelo	Hal9000	if your sound card is also a nvidia or ati chipset that might also be an issue but what do I know
2008-02-25T03:22:00.000Z	Hal9000	Pelo	sound card is from connexant / intel hd audio
