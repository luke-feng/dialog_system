2010-07-16T02:36:00.000Z	VCoolio	preecher	go for gtk2, metacity is window borders but a lot of gtk2 include them
2010-07-16T02:38:00.000Z	VCoolio	preecher	if you get metacity or gtk2 without borders you need to hit customize in the appearance window to find and select them
2010-07-16T02:39:00.000Z	preecher	VCoolio	oh ok
