2009-06-28T01:19:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	mandrig	i have tried having "compiz --replace" in the startup applications.. but I also have used the "fusion icon" as well to manage both compiz and emerald
2009-06-28T01:20:00.000Z	mandrig	WIGGMPk	I don't use emerald, so I'm not sure, but try having just 'compiz' in the startup.
2009-06-28T01:20:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	mandrig	like I said.. I have tried that.. and I have tried using fusion icon.. compiz does NOT load at start
2009-06-28T01:21:00.000Z	mandrig	WIGGMPk	I mean, not compiz --replace, just compiz
2009-06-28T01:21:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	mandrig	I can give it a shot
