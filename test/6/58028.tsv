2010-03-01T17:44:00.000Z	abhi_nav_		whats the exact purpose and target audience of xfce?
2010-03-01T17:44:00.000Z	becker_11	abhi_nav_	xfce is for systems that are slightly older than the latest and greatest and for users that don't want alot of overhead on their systems
2010-03-01T17:45:00.000Z	becker_11	abhi_nav_	I like xfce because it is lighter than gnome and runs faster on my system
2010-03-01T17:45:00.000Z	abhi_nav_	DaemonFC	& becker_11: ok should i install it on my ubuntu to get more speed and performance? I now have gnome
2010-03-01T17:46:00.000Z	becker_11	abhi_nav_	sure
