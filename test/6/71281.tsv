2007-12-06T09:51:00.000Z	defyence		I finally figured out how to install Pidgin (2.3.0), got it all done, did it by compiling the source code...
2007-12-06T09:51:00.000Z	defyence		...And it won't open. Any advice?
2007-12-06T09:51:00.000Z	FluxD	defyence	what did typing in pidgin show?
2007-12-06T09:52:00.000Z	defyence	FluxD	One second, I tried opening it my classic Windows-trained-brain way by double-clicking the icon... Lemme try it. :P
2007-12-06T09:53:00.000Z	FluxD	defyence	did u have that compile too?
2007-12-06T09:53:00.000Z	defyence	FluxD	Nope
