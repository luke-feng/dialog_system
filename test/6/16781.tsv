2010-10-11T21:45:00.000Z	Zavor		I had a slight problem with some games. I installed Warsow and AssaultCube on my Ubuntu box, played for a while, then updated my computer. Now, the mouse is not working within either of those programs, but other games work just fine. Is there a fix for this?

2010-10-11T21:46:00.000Z	ganeshran	Zavor	I tried last time and the whole system got corrupted because power went off :(
2010-10-11T21:47:00.000Z	ganeshran	Zavor	this time to be on the safer side, I downloaded it from the torrent
