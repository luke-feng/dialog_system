2011-02-13T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Philip__	you should boot to root recovery mode and run: apt-get -f install    to make the upgrade complete
2011-02-13T18:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Philip__	hold shift at boot, select recovery mode, select root
2011-02-13T18:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Philip__	use the hardware driver app under system
