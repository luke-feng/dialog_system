2009-03-21T06:25:00.000Z	UncleD-		I'm trying to get it to echo "unknown" if the response from ping contains the words "unknown host"

2009-03-21T06:58:00.000Z	LjL	UncleD-	if [ $PING_RESULT "unknown" ]; is wrong. "ping" doesn't output "unknown", it outputs something more like "ping: unknown host" or somesuch. also, there's an -eq missing there
