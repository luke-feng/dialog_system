2006-11-20T15:39:00.000Z	rioghal	Some_Person	yes, there is:  sudo chattr +i file   but, if the system needs to re-write that file, it wont be able to do it

2006-11-20T15:43:00.000Z	rioghal	Some_Person	it will be readable, but it will not be writable
2006-11-20T15:44:00.000Z	rioghal	Some_Person	to be readable to all users, youll have to chmod a+r
