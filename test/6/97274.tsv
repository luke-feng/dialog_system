2007-04-21T06:46:00.000Z	elpargo	codeyman	update-manager -d worked like a charm here
2007-04-21T06:47:00.000Z	codeyman	elpargo	well am a bit paranoid... it was a charm during the earlier upgrade too.. but it broke lots of stuff..
2007-04-21T06:47:00.000Z	elpargo	codeyman	yes it did
2007-04-21T06:48:00.000Z	codeyman	elpargo	So nothing this time right...?
