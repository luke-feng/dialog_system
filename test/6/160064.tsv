2005-02-22T14:56:00.000Z	Thom_Ubuntu		erm, why not?
2005-02-22T14:56:00.000Z	Thom_Ubuntu		there is no decent linux distro for sparc, so ubuntu fills a gap
2005-02-22T14:56:00.000Z	Thom_Ubuntu		mine does :)
2005-02-22T14:57:00.000Z	Thom_Ubuntu		no
2005-02-22T14:58:00.000Z	Amaranth	Thom_Ubuntu	You should use Solaris 10, I hear it's really nice. ;)
