2009-01-22T08:00:00.000Z	DevilSShadoW		dont get me wrong it's not extremely irgent for me to have a fat32 partition
2009-01-22T08:00:00.000Z	DevilSShadoW		i just think its a waste for 160gb for linux
2009-01-22T08:00:00.000Z	lifenova1	DevilSShadoW	did your problem get solved? I was going to recommend you get a program in windows that can read an ext3 partition rather than converting to fat32.
2009-01-22T08:00:00.000Z	lifenova1	DevilSShadoW	I will find you a link, hold on
2009-01-22T08:01:00.000Z	lifenova1	DevilSShadoW	http://www.diskinternals.com/linux-reader/ is the one I use. It's not perfect, but it works.
