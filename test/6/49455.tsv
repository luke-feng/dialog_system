2008-10-16T17:09:00.000Z	Akhanu`	ntemis	you can burn anything you like with brasero just as you can do the same with NeroBurning
2008-10-16T17:10:00.000Z	Akhanu`	ntemis	You just need to think of the copy protection things.
2008-10-16T17:12:00.000Z	Akhanu`	ntemis	I'd google around for any forums that discuss this topic then. I doubt you'll find many here who have a speciffic experience as you require.
