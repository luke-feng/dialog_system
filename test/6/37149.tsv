2009-07-17T22:28:00.000Z	skellington		atheros 5700

2009-07-17T22:52:00.000Z	jrib	skellington	well you could have several distros share it
2009-07-17T22:52:00.000Z	skellington	jrib	but if im only using one distro then theres no point. right?
2009-07-17T22:53:00.000Z	jrib	skellington	I don't see one
