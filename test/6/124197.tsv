2006-03-04T14:53:00.000Z	Ruy	soundray	thanks it's a download manager i get it from de synaptic, so it worked fine about two days, whit a nice interface, but suddendly it collapsed and nothing happens now
2006-03-04T14:53:00.000Z	soundray	Ruy	did you do a lot of configuration?
2006-03-04T14:56:00.000Z	soundray	Ruy	many programs store per-user configuration items in a directory or file called "~/.programname". So try "rm -rf ~/.d4x" to start over with the configuration. Danger: don't mistype.
