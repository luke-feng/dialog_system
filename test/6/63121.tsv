2008-02-28T18:20:00.000Z	soussou		When I use firefox to search for something, the suggestions that pop up are unreadable, as they are black on a black background.
2008-02-28T18:20:00.000Z	soussou		any ideas how this can be changed?
2008-02-28T18:21:00.000Z	soussou		bod: I tried that one, it doesn't work
2008-02-28T18:23:00.000Z	soussou		bod: it's a radical solution
