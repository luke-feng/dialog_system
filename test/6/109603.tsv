2006-09-21T15:08:00.000Z	Zolace		Hey
2006-09-21T15:09:00.000Z	Zolace		I think we all have questions hehe
2006-09-21T15:09:00.000Z	Zolace		Something quite trivial for me, about GAIM
2006-09-21T15:09:00.000Z	Zolace		Actually a couple of things
2006-09-21T15:10:00.000Z	Zolace		I have two questions. 1, On X chat, is there any way to have a list of users at the side of the screen like on normal IRC? And also on GAIM what does it mean if your contact has an red X next to their icon?
