2005-06-03T07:48:00.000Z	nubbe		is there any way to make Nautilus display a simple list and/or (most importantly) choose/mark with the mouse like it's possible in icon-view?
2005-06-03T07:49:00.000Z	reka	nubbe	i'd be interested in an answer afaik you can't select multiples in list mode without holding shift or ctrl.
2005-06-03T07:50:00.000Z	nubbe	reka	my experience too  :(
2005-06-03T07:51:00.000Z	reka	nubbe	maybe try a different fm if you're desperate.  i just resorted to using icon view in 50%
2005-06-03T07:53:00.000Z	nubbe	reka	not desperate yet, just thought it SHOULD be possible to do that...
2005-06-03T07:56:00.000Z	reka	nubbe	i agree.  and if it was implemented, i'd use it.
