2010-04-09T21:26:00.000Z	bjarkef	jrib	He said all dot files and folders, I guess that is everything in the home folder except files directly in the home folder. Will be a bit more tricky ... ;)
2010-04-09T21:26:00.000Z	jrib	bjarkef	I think he meant all dot (files and folders) but maybe you are right.  Only dr3mro knows for sure :)
2010-04-09T21:27:00.000Z	jrib	bjarkef	we'll never know now!
2010-04-09T21:27:00.000Z	bjarkef	jrib	That would make sense.
2010-04-09T21:27:00.000Z	bjarkef	jrib	I guess he got what he wanted.
