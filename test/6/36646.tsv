2011-02-07T16:56:00.000Z	danboid		Doesn't seem very intuitive to me so far- seems like a step back from regular GNOME

2011-02-07T16:57:00.000Z	danboid	sagaci	Nothing happens
2011-02-07T16:59:00.000Z	danboid	sagaci	Tried latest daily build on a couple of machines and right-clicking bar on left does nothing
2011-02-07T16:59:00.000Z	sagaci	danboid	right clicking can be a bit buggy
