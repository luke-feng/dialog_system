2007-07-14T10:31:00.000Z	polaris		I've installed PHP5 and Apache 2 under Ubuntu 7 - can someone tell me what to add to httpd.conf so that Apache uses the PHP module?

2007-07-14T10:32:00.000Z	burner	polaris	define "normal"  does "normal" entail apt-get install blahblah?
2007-07-14T10:32:00.000Z	polaris	burner	yes
