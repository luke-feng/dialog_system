2009-12-04T23:44:00.000Z	mr_engineer	grawity	well, they're not starting up lol, what could be causing the problem?
2009-12-04T23:44:00.000Z	grawity	mr_engineer	What if you start one of them manually?
2009-12-04T23:44:00.000Z	mr_engineer	grawity	i can
2009-12-04T23:45:00.000Z	mr_engineer	grawity	its not the ideal thing though
