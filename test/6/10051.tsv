2011-07-15T04:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkoudys	I'd imagine so, would take some work
2011-07-15T04:20:00.000Z	jkoudys	ActionParsnip	tips on where to start?
2011-07-15T04:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkoudys	not something I've done but I can imagine its possible
2011-07-15T04:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jkoudys	look into xmodmap is all I can suggest
