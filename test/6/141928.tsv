2005-12-14T15:18:00.000Z	wftl	drkfiber	: thought about that. I was looking for something that didn't require you knowing the name of the running app.
2005-12-14T15:18:00.000Z	wftl		Thanks, though.

The system monitor is a great way to do this, but if I wanted to give this to a non-command line savvy individual, they might not be able to make the connection between the running app and the command listed there.  gnome-cd is a pretty obvious one, but not everything is going to be.
