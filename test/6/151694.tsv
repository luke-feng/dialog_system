2005-04-29T10:13:00.000Z	grumpysmurf		I don't really think brown is a great color, but chocolate rules.
2005-04-29T10:14:00.000Z	grumpysmurf		actually, i switched my metacity theme to 'clean' i think, with the blueslate coloring, and then swapped the red and blue values in the default background color so it would be blue instead of brown
2005-04-29T10:14:00.000Z	grumpysmurf		so i can think of it like blue chocolate.
