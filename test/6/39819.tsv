2009-07-08T01:28:00.000Z	dudette	vox	That would be a hardlink then, right?!
2009-07-08T01:29:00.000Z	vox	dudette	no, it's a softlink
2009-07-08T01:29:00.000Z	dudette		OK. Thx
2009-07-08T01:30:00.000Z	dudette		And the softlink then automatically has the same ownership/permissions as the target that it points to?
2009-07-08T01:31:00.000Z	vox	dudette	correct
