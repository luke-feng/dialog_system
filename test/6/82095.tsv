2007-07-25T08:56:00.000Z	Shaftooooo	I_Have_No_Idea	I wouldnt worry about that, just use ext3 :), If anything happens you can delete it from windows anyway, and well you need a / and a swap
2007-07-25T08:57:00.000Z	I_Have_No_Idea	Shaftooooo	a what and a swap?
2007-07-25T08:58:00.000Z	Shaftooooo	I_Have_No_Idea	The installer will do it for you, honestly, I think you can either set your entire HD to windows then have it resize for you, or you can get it to use free space if you leave some HD space
