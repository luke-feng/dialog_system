2008-07-02T05:57:00.000Z	tj83		well i certainly have an issue with that 3945 card Fryguy-- i have searched google forever
2008-07-02T05:57:00.000Z	tj83		jack_sparrow do you have any info on intel 3945 wireless?
2008-07-02T05:58:00.000Z	DeadKennedy2880	tj83	- i also had no issues with the same card, perhaps that explains the lack of info on google. what have you tried so far?
2008-07-02T05:58:00.000Z	tj83	DeadKennedy2880	tried adjusting time out value ... was one suggestion.. tried backports.
2008-07-02T06:00:00.000Z	DeadKennedy2880	tj83	- im thinkin you did more harm by messing with the settings
