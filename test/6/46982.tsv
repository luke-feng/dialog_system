2009-07-18T22:35:00.000Z	[R]	syva	when you are booting in grub, hit c and then you can get to the grub command line and use tab completion to figure out what you want
2009-07-18T22:35:00.000Z	syva	[R]	okay ill give that a go
2009-07-18T22:36:00.000Z	[R]	syva	well you can run grub from the command line
2009-07-18T22:36:00.000Z	[R]	syva	but sometimes it doesnt retunr the same results
