2011-04-20T05:27:00.000Z	Snappleseed		Download package indexes failed, please check your network status. Most drivers will not be available. then the window says No Proprietary drivers are in use on this system
2011-04-20T05:28:00.000Z	Snappleseed		I can't, actually. I only have wireless taken from the library next door.
2011-04-20T05:28:00.000Z	Snappleseed		I've been out of money for a fair bit now.
2011-04-20T05:29:00.000Z	Snappleseed		So how, other than hooking up to the internet, can I obtain the relevant firmware? Diamondcite: I'm online on my Windows 7 HP, on a seperate computer.
