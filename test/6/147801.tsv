2005-05-22T06:39:00.000Z	dabaStnd	TheShoe	some things are easier command line:)
2005-05-22T06:40:00.000Z	TheShoe	dabaStnd	yes i understand that, especially in linux, but there should be easy point and click ways to do most things (apart from maybe really advanced complex things) for people like me
2005-05-22T06:42:00.000Z	dabaStnd	TheShoe	that is the whole thing about cli being easier...
