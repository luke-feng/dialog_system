2008-11-08T22:49:00.000Z	gravemind		Hi, the shutdown and restart buttons are missing on my account's logout menu, but another account on this same computer has them. How do I get them back
2008-11-08T22:50:00.000Z	NekroJakub	gravemind	Try changing your system theme maybe?
2008-11-08T22:50:00.000Z	gravemind	NekroJakub	thanks for the idea! I'll try
2008-11-08T22:51:00.000Z	gravemind	NekroJakub	no, unfortunately changing system themes doesn't change the logout menu
2008-11-08T22:52:00.000Z	NekroJakub	gravemind	I'm pretty sure everything is customisable, so maybe there's a seperate category for the logout menu
2008-11-08T22:53:00.000Z	gravemind	NekroJakub	alright, thanks, I'll look for it
