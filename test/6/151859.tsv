2007-09-26T12:15:00.000Z	[nrx] 	dromer	try the paperclip method
2007-09-26T12:16:00.000Z	[nrx] 	dromer	that hole in the drive door...it's for a paperclip - so you can open the drive
2007-09-26T12:17:00.000Z	[nrx] 	dromer	stick the paperclip in the hole.. it'll be stiff, but push it hard and the drawer will slip out
