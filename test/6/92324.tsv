2007-03-09T13:58:00.000Z	joe4444		ok, i've installed the ATI binary drivers following the docs, but fglrxinfo still isn't reporting my OpenGL renderer or vendor strings as ATI; they are Mesa something... my resolution is now correct, but i'm still getting the same image on both displays
2007-03-09T13:58:00.000Z	joe4444		any suggestions?
2007-03-09T13:58:00.000Z	Ubuntu-Anon	joe4444	Use super glue
2007-03-09T13:58:00.000Z	joe4444	Ubuntu-Anon	?
2007-03-09T14:01:00.000Z	joe4444	Ubuntu-Anon	you're trying to help me get both displays working as one big desktop instead of 2 identical desktops =)
