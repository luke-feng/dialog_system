2010-12-31T15:42:00.000Z	gobbe	Roaster	this channel is only for ubuntu-support
2010-12-31T15:45:00.000Z	gobbe	Roaster	gnutrack is not ubuntu, it's based on ubuntu
2010-12-31T15:45:00.000Z	gobbe	Roaster	so #gnutrack or something else is supportchannel for that
2010-12-31T15:47:00.000Z	gobbe	Roaster	yes, like you told. It's combination, and it's not same thing. So it's not supported here
