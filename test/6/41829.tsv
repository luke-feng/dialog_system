2009-10-15T10:25:00.000Z	ekontsevoy	ZykoticK9	Thank you, I am quite familiar with consoles, I am just surprised to see screen there. I don't want it, because I run screen via ssh on my servers, and screen inside of screen is painful, so I am looking how to turn this off.
2009-10-15T10:25:00.000Z	ekontsevoy	ZykoticK9	in other words I want plain consoles by default as before (I have upgraded from 8.04)
2009-10-15T10:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	ekontsevoy	in that case just exit the screen session :) - but i don't know how it works in Karmic - so you might wanna checkout #ubuntu+1
