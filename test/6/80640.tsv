2007-08-17T14:31:00.000Z	dariuskane	Arafangion	the default is DHCP during the install
2007-08-17T14:32:00.000Z	Arafangion	dariuskane	Yes, but if it doesn't get a DHCP response, it doesn't go on a limb and blindly pick an IP address.
2007-08-17T14:33:00.000Z	dariuskane	Arafangion	there is a set range of private ips that are used when no dhcp response is received 169.254.0.0 -169.254.255.255
2007-08-17T14:33:00.000Z	Arafangion	dariuskane	Doesn't mean I like it.
2007-08-17T14:51:00.000Z	Arafangion	dariuskane	Remind me exactly what type they were again.
