2005-08-31T12:40:00.000Z	Rimu		you need a web server
2005-08-31T12:40:00.000Z	Rimu		the web server interprets PHP and spits out HTML, which browsers can handle
2005-08-31T12:42:00.000Z	Rimu		chmod 644 <filename>
2005-08-31T12:43:00.000Z	Rimu		you should also be able to change the access permissions by right-clicking on the file and going 'properties'
2005-08-31T12:43:00.000Z	Rimu		anyway, gotta run. thanks for the help
