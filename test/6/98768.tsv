2006-12-23T14:34:00.000Z	LinuxNewb7331		I have an nvidia card, would the driver be the most likely problem, if so how would I fix it

2006-12-23T14:43:00.000Z	un_operateur	LinuxNewb7331	why not just folllow the wiki -- time and effort has already been put into it
2006-12-23T14:44:00.000Z	un_operateur	LinuxNewb7331	well, check, and double check -- if at that stage you still cant find it-- then ask us
