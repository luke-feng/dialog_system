2008-06-07T15:50:00.000Z	natalisushka		Hi! I am having a problem with my mouse, after installing ubuntu 8.04 it works for a while and then it stops! I unplug it and plug it to another laptop, and it works, I plug it back to the first laptop and still doesn't move until I restart the computer! How can I solve this?
