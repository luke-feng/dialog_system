2010-11-24T05:08:00.000Z	The_Paco		I've chown and chgrp a bunch of mp3s and a directory I want to move them to to my name and my group, but can't move them to the directory without sudo. Why?
2010-11-24T05:08:00.000Z	edbian	The_Paco	What are the permissions on the destination folder?
2010-11-24T05:10:00.000Z	The_Paco	edbian	also owned by me and in my group, also can't move it
2010-11-24T05:11:00.000Z	edbian	The_Paco	Can you pastebin ls -l on the files and ls -l on the dest folder?
