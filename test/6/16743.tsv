2011-06-10T19:10:00.000Z	oCean	Typh	not sure what you mean by modifier key though
2011-06-10T19:11:00.000Z	Typh	oCean	yeah, that
2011-06-10T19:12:00.000Z	Typh	oCean	yeah, same. I might have to just settle for seperate keys.
2011-06-10T19:18:00.000Z	Typh	oCean	that looks promising
2011-06-10T19:19:00.000Z	oCean	Typh	I think so, I hope it's useful.. I have to run afk for a while.
