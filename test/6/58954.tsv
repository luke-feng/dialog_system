2008-04-30T21:24:00.000Z	xkrchnav		Hello, please do you recomment Ubuntu for old computer (Duron 1000, 256 MB RAM). Main think I want to use it for is TV card. Card is also old one conexant fusion 878a probably. It is on the chip. Sorry for repost - connection problems

2008-04-30T21:27:00.000Z	xkrchnav	AncientPC	thanks. But I don't want to buy anything there it is really old - it would be better to buy completely new
2008-04-30T21:28:00.000Z	AncientPC	xkrchnav	use Puppy Linux or DSL or Knoppix, Wikipedia / distrowatch will have more info.
