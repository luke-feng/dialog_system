2010-12-28T02:55:00.000Z	piercedw1ter	BernardV	I'll give it a try. Thanks.
2010-12-28T02:55:00.000Z	BernardV	piercedw1ter	What is the client you're using?
2010-12-28T02:57:00.000Z	BernardV	piercedw1ter	Because if it's iTunes or a client that can see iTunes shares, firefly is easy to use. Just ssh -L port:localhost:port and announce it localy..
2010-12-28T02:58:00.000Z	piercedw1ter	BernardV	I'm actually using Clementine :(
2010-12-28T02:58:00.000Z	BernardV	piercedw1ter	Don't know that one... sorry
