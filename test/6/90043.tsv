2009-02-15T06:00:00.000Z	jrib	cphillips	one way is to just list files one per line
2009-02-15T06:01:00.000Z	cphillips	jrib	okay, but how do i do that automatically? i just want to shuffle my whole library.
2009-02-15T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	cphillips	you should be able to just pass all the files on the command line to mplayer
2009-02-15T06:03:00.000Z	cphillips	jrib	with what command?
2009-02-15T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	cphillips	just glob them
