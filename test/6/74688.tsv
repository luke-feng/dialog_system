2008-08-20T10:58:00.000Z	Achoth		Hello. I recently tried installing Vista to dual boot with XP & Ubuntu. After the installation I restored GRUB, and can start Vista & Ubuntu. However, when I choose XP, I just get an error message telling me I "can't mount the selected partition". Any ideas?

2008-08-20T11:01:00.000Z	Achoth	Forgott3n`	I've tried all diffrent possibillities, I either boot Vista, boot Ubuntu, get "no such partition" message or "can't mount partition" message
