2008-03-08T19:59:00.000Z	kane77	brobostigon	oh.. didn't know that...
2008-03-08T20:00:00.000Z	brobostigon	kane77	freenode will not let you connect to freenode through tor
2008-03-08T20:00:00.000Z	kane77	brobostigon	nevermind.. I'm sometimes paranoid for no reason... :)
2008-03-08T20:01:00.000Z	brobostigon	kane77	it works for most other things, but that was one thing i found that it never works,
