2008-12-06T10:19:00.000Z	MrMustard	HorizonXP	just use /etc/host
2008-12-06T10:20:00.000Z	MrMustard	HorizonXP	I mean /etc/hosts
2008-12-06T10:20:00.000Z	HorizonXP	MrMustard	My ISP's DNS isn't that great, which is why I use BIND9 to grab DNS entries from the root servers directly
2008-12-06T10:21:00.000Z	MrMustard	HorizonXP	oh, i guess you couldn't use /etc/hosts for that - maybe it's time to find a new ISP?
2008-12-06T10:21:00.000Z	HorizonXP	MrMustard	lol, ISPs great otherwise. and i'm in Canada, not much choice in ISPs
