2006-03-22T10:16:00.000Z	ITSa341	silvaran	 I already moved it to /home/myname/position to avoid spaces in folder names such as My Documents etc

2006-03-22T10:17:00.000Z	ITSa341	silvaran	 I have been trying to figure this out for hours
2006-03-22T10:47:00.000Z	ITSa341	silvaran	 just remember, almost everything MS has in Windows was stolen or bought from someone else and then bloated by MS so if ya look at it that way...it's all old news anyway
