2010-06-25T13:30:00.000Z	Sangeeth	YankDownUnder	: :D Ok... But, i'm striving for 10 GB freespace, 'cause my hard disk is only of 150 GB capacity...
2010-06-25T13:32:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Sangeeth	Yes. Don't muck with the swap partition(s)
2010-06-25T13:33:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Sangeeth	Usually 1.5 to 2 times the amount of installed RAM, yes.
2010-06-25T13:36:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	Sangeeth	Have you considered deleting all your pr0n to free up some space?
