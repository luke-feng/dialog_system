2007-04-06T16:05:00.000Z	Flannel	dj_baggio	reinstall
2007-04-06T16:05:00.000Z	Flannel	dj_baggio	correction.  Backup, then reinstall.
2007-04-06T16:06:00.000Z	Flannel	dj_baggio	NExt time you leave your terminal open, do 'sudo -k' to wipe the cached password
2007-04-06T16:07:00.000Z	Flannel	dj_baggio	Windows recovery wouldn't help in this situation either.  You COULD wade through a bnch of crap.  But reinstalling really is the easiest and quickest method
2007-04-06T16:07:00.000Z	Flannel	dj_baggio	right.  There's no way of knowing what's missing and what's still there reliably.  Especially if your package management is hosed.
