2008-03-21T09:00:00.000Z	Jangari		i have a command that I want to make an executable program, essentially, it's in my local /bin directory on a server, ow do I make it so I can run it?
2008-03-21T09:00:00.000Z	Jangari		how*
2008-03-21T09:01:00.000Z	Jangari		no, a text file that just contains a command
2008-03-21T09:01:00.000Z	unop__	Jangari	place the file in /usr/local/bin and chmod it -- sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/program_name
2008-03-21T09:03:00.000Z	unop__	Jangari	quite unlikely -- 764 doesnt lets group or other users execute the file
2008-03-21T09:03:00.000Z	unop__	Jangari	only the owner of that file will be able to execute it, and that's probably root
