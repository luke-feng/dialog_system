2006-03-02T15:17:00.000Z	bluepixel	geneo93	then anybody try to install ubuntu on a 386-intel? :)
2006-03-02T15:18:00.000Z	geneo93	bluepixel	 i doubt if you could get enough memory in a i386
2006-03-02T15:19:00.000Z	bluepixel	geneo93	of course not! because of that, i find it very strange to compile the whole system for i386 instead of at least i586
2006-03-02T15:20:00.000Z	geneo93	bluepixel	 mandriva is one of the first ones to move to i586
2006-03-02T15:21:00.000Z	bluepixel	geneo93	suse , too
