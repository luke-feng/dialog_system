2007-07-13T16:27:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	bullgard4	a key combo is hitting a few keys at the same time
2007-07-13T16:27:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	bullgard4	for example CONTROL-C for copy is a key combo
2007-07-13T16:27:00.000Z	bullgard4	Newbie_Dude	Isn't  such a procedure called a 'key combination'?
2007-07-13T16:28:00.000Z	Newbie_Dude	bullgard4	Yes, but "combo" is short for "combination"
2007-07-13T16:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	Newbie_Dude	Thank you very much for explaining.
