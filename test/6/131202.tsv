2006-03-12T17:41:00.000Z	djm62	Fracture	um, you mean a gnome web browser?
2006-03-12T17:41:00.000Z	Fracture	djm62	no.
2006-03-12T17:41:00.000Z	Fracture	djm62	I'd like something that has a UI interface like tomboy, but is also a wiki
2006-03-12T17:42:00.000Z	Fracture	djm62	i.e. that has both web editing interface, as well as a rich desktop interface
2006-03-12T17:42:00.000Z	djm62	Fracture	nope, can't think of anything like that (still getting the hang of tomboy, to be honest)
