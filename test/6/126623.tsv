2006-01-17T10:26:00.000Z	Znort		Anybody knows what's the minimum disk space for ubuntu 5.10?
2006-01-17T10:27:00.000Z	mjr	Znort	I believe about 2 gigs for a default desktop install
2006-01-17T10:28:00.000Z	Znort	mjr	I tried to install it today but it needed at least 24gig :S
2006-01-17T10:28:00.000Z	mjr	Znort	if it said it needed, it lied
2006-01-17T10:28:00.000Z	mjr		or there was some misunderstanding
2006-01-17T10:29:00.000Z	Znort	mjr	I said it to resize the existing partition. I gave 10gig but it said it wasnt enough :S
