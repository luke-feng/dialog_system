2008-03-20T05:19:00.000Z	kris_ph		 Apache/2.2.4 (Ubuntu) <<< is this the latest in the repo?
2008-03-20T05:21:00.000Z	Fryguy--	kris_ph	assuming you updated your repo using apt-get update, yes
2008-03-20T05:23:00.000Z	Fryguy--	kris_ph	releases of ubuntu don't upgrade major revisions of software
2008-03-20T05:26:00.000Z	Fryguy--	kris_ph	security updates are made, major revisions aren't upgraded. simple.
2008-03-20T05:26:00.000Z	Fryguy--	kris_ph	you realize like, 1/3 of the internet, is still using apache 1.x, right?
