I am planning to restore it to a real partition I have made on my new machine. I am confused as most of the guides assume you are using a current wubi install to make the conversion, not a backed up disk. Any help?

2010-12-18T10:58:00.000Z	ryan___	ActionParsnip	Thanks for the suggestion. I have tried this, however because of the different UIDs and other information in the old root.disk, Wubi is unable to boot from it using this method. I assume I need to mount it and copy files over. How does one mount root.disk?

2010-12-18T11:05:00.000Z	ryan___	ActionParsnip	 Cheers for that, I will give it a try. Yes wubi became rather tedious to work with once I realized it's limitations, especially for migration.
