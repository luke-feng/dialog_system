2005-06-28T05:11:00.000Z	Speckmade		Hey, someone there who can tell me how to get root-rights? I've enough of those messages telling me "you can't do this, you can't do that". I'm the owner of my computer and I don't want to use "sudo" and learn all those commands before I can rule my machine.
2005-06-28T05:12:00.000Z	djm62	Speckmade	on your own head be it.  sudo -s then passwd to give root a passwd.  If you need to be told this, I really don't advise you to run as root
2005-06-28T05:13:00.000Z	djm62	Speckmade	and many more good reasons not to run as root
2005-06-28T05:14:00.000Z	djm62	Speckmade	I'd guess most of the seasoned users here are used to having a root account, and have adapted easily to not having one
2005-06-28T05:15:00.000Z	djm62	Speckmade	there is _nothing_ that you can't do with sudo
2005-06-28T05:16:00.000Z	djm62	Speckmade	you are entitled to break your machine, and it is only a disk after all
