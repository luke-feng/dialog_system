2005-10-03T12:15:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Travis|H	cvs is mostly for version control, but yes, you can get unstable source code with it
2005-10-03T12:15:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Travis|H	and if you get the release date right, you can get stable code with it
2005-10-03T12:15:00.000Z	Travis|H	cevizoglu	but as far as the source obtained with cvs ... just compile it normal?
2005-10-03T12:16:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Travis|H	yes
2005-10-03T13:39:00.000Z	cevizoglu	Travis|H	it's a known issue with mplayer
