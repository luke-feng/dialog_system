2008-04-15T04:34:00.000Z	savageone		I want to sell machines with ubuntu but there's the issue of licensing for dvd playback.  Dell is using corel's lindvd.  Anyone else aware of any other pay-for product so I can do this right?  I don't wnat to get into any legal trouble.  We're in the US.  How are other manufacturers handling this?

2008-04-15T04:36:00.000Z	savageone		I can appreciate that some people's approach is to let the custome figure it out but we're dealing with some rather difficult rather wealthy customers
2008-04-15T04:38:00.000Z	savageone		does the pay-for ubuntu version come with legal dvd playback?
2008-04-15T04:38:00.000Z	amenado	savageone	 dont know if movieX or emovieX have those restrictions, i dont know much about it.
