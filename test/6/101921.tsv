2006-11-25T14:48:00.000Z	kitche	H3g3m0n	yes ipv6 will slow down ipv4 if that's all you have I usually turn ipv6 off in firefox and it speeds up great
2006-11-25T14:51:00.000Z	kitche	H3g3m0n	do you want to know how to turn ipv6 off in firefox?
2006-11-25T14:51:00.000Z	H3g3m0n	kitche	about:config in the address bar, search for ipv6
2006-11-25T14:51:00.000Z	kitche	H3g3m0n	yeah I know how to do it myself just wondering if you wanted to turn it off
2006-11-25T14:53:00.000Z	kitche	H3g3m0n	it's used a lot, it's mostly used on I2 really
