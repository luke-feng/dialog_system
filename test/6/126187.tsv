2006-06-04T09:33:00.000Z	christian		how can you add resolutions to the gnome-display properties
2006-06-04T09:34:00.000Z	christian		because it is getting resolutions not in my xorg.conf file
2006-06-04T09:34:00.000Z	christian		and thus i'm stuck with those resolutions
2006-06-04T09:34:00.000Z	christian		well...i'm stuck on 1920x1200 and that resolution is not in my xorg.conf
2006-06-04T09:35:00.000Z	christian		the resolution is too big...so I've never used it and always take it out
2006-06-04T09:35:00.000Z	slavik	christian	what resolution would you like?
