2007-11-19T11:48:00.000Z	jals		is there a way to get compiz/scale to behave exactly like expose?
2007-11-19T11:49:00.000Z	Crozar	jals	you mean to orginize windows as a table view infront of y our screen>/
2007-11-19T11:49:00.000Z	Crozar	jals	just go to options and bindings my friend
2007-11-19T11:50:00.000Z	jals	Crozar	i did try that, but it doesn't behave how i'd expect
2007-11-19T11:51:00.000Z	Crozar	jals	you must use the bindings , its a problem when you dont understand hwo to use it
2007-11-19T11:51:00.000Z	Crozar	jals	go to #compiz channel and see how they will help you
