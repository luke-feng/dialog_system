2008-10-12T22:31:00.000Z	mutz1243		i dont know do i need one?
2008-10-12T22:32:00.000Z	mutz1243		well i havent gotten anything yet i was just wondering in case anything ever did happen
2008-10-12T22:32:00.000Z	mutz1243		i guess its pretty hard to get a virus on linux right?
2008-10-12T22:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	mutz1243	yep.. usually only use virus protection as a protection for your windows friends...
2008-10-12T22:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	mutz1243	or better yet.. get them to convert and not worry anymore.
