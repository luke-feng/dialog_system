Please use the "Advanced" mode to install 'umbrello'." How do you get into the Advanced mode and is it dangerous?

2006-04-13T06:33:00.000Z	TheCreature	carthik	so synaptic manager is the advanced mode of add programs?
2006-04-13T06:33:00.000Z	carthik	TheCreature	yes it is so - find out by clicking that advanced mode button :)
2006-04-13T06:34:00.000Z	carthik	TheCreature	you cannot break much if you read the messages before clicking buttons :)
2006-04-13T06:35:00.000Z	TheCreature	carthik	where's the advanced mode button ><  /me blind
