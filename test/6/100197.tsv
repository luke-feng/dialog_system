2007-10-09T11:07:00.000Z	genii	ganes1	Well, first off you shouldn't install foreign package types like rpm if at all possible
2007-10-09T11:09:00.000Z	genii	ganes1	There is probably a decent python editor with a package you can install the normal way without using Alien for some rpm file.
2007-10-09T11:10:00.000Z	genii	ganes1	i do not program much in python to know what is a good editor for it.
2007-10-09T11:11:00.000Z	genii	ganes1	pype seems recommended
2007-10-09T11:12:00.000Z	genii	ganes1	i found a list of install candidates by:   apt-cache search python|grep edit
