2004-11-02T15:33:00.000Z	skar	twitchgame	if it does, then i'll be over the moon
2004-11-02T15:34:00.000Z	skar	twitchgame	i've been using gnotime and it was great, just fast and simple to use, a few clicks for every 2-3 hours or so :)
2004-11-02T15:36:00.000Z	skar		how do i integrate planner with evolution calendar?
2004-11-02T15:37:00.000Z	skar	twitchgame	i guess thats what you meant, right?
2004-11-02T15:38:00.000Z	twitchgame	skar	i don't actually know what evo can or can't do but i would have thought it would have some sort of task functionality in it
