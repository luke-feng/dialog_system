2010-08-13T16:24:00.000Z	jatt		which software do I need to connect my laptop to a video projector?
2010-08-13T16:25:00.000Z	jatt		I connected my laptop (runs ubuntu) with the projector but it wasn't automatically recognized
2010-08-13T16:26:00.000Z	jatt		my laptop has buttons to switch to the projector, it works on windows 7
2010-08-13T16:26:00.000Z	jatt		I pressed those buttons but it didn't work under ubuntu
2010-08-13T16:26:00.000Z	jatt		that's why I am asking if a special software needs to be installed.
