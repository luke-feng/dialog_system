2011-03-25T04:49:00.000Z	critical_max	aguenter	you could try later - it's a pretty specific question and it's just no one knows at the moment.
2011-03-25T04:50:00.000Z	aguenter	critical_max	I will, it just seems like I might have better luck on the forums as IRC seems to be overloaded with "easier" questions
2011-03-25T04:51:00.000Z	critical_max	aguenter	plenty of technical advice here, it's just no one has that precise situation. I'd definitely start a thread for now.
2011-03-25T04:51:00.000Z	aguenter	critical_max	I didn't mean to imply that there wasn't. I'll go ahead and do that, thanks :)
2011-03-25T04:51:00.000Z	critical_max	aguenter	good luck!
