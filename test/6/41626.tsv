2011-06-11T08:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Magic-Fx	if you press a key does something happen?
2011-06-11T08:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Magic-Fx	try rebooting and as SOON as you see that screen press a key (hopefully you'll get a menu with boot options)
2011-06-11T08:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Magic-Fx	space maybe?  i don't think it matters (could be wrong)
