2011-12-18T05:17:00.000Z	escott	calwig	given the number of changes from 8.04 to 11.04 a reinstall may be the best approach. see !clone
2011-12-18T05:17:00.000Z	calwig		apt-get?
2011-12-18T05:18:00.000Z	escott	calwig	the upgrade script is do-release-upgrade
2011-12-18T05:18:00.000Z	calwig	escott	i guess i may have to do that
