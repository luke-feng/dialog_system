2011-05-15T00:34:00.000Z	wdkey1		Hi there,
2011-05-15T00:34:00.000Z	wdkey1		I've been trying to install and setup Ubuntu 11.04 (64-bit) on my laptop to replace Windows 7 for the past week, but I can't get past an issue which makes the second monitor all fuzzy and shaky. I've tried to play with the system settings, but I'm still new to Ubuntu.
2011-05-15T00:34:00.000Z	wdkey1		Here is some extra info:
2011-05-15T00:34:00.000Z	wdkey1		VGA: ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5650 with Intel GMA HD Switchable Graphics
2011-05-15T00:34:00.000Z	wdkey1		Monitor: Dell UltraSharp U2311H (IPS)
