2006-12-07T17:58:00.000Z	DARKGuy		Is there a good bittorrent client that can accept resuming? Azureus just crashes if I start it up after an X crash, so i plainly lose my downloaded bits. bittornado in curses interface doesn't resume my downloads, anybody know of one that can resume downloads and have a download cap that I can set up?
