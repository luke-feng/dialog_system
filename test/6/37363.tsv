2009-06-18T04:27:00.000Z	david___		i have ls give me all the .dats, but then i want a text file that simply appends "plot" to the beginning of each. like "plot xxx.dat"
2009-06-18T04:27:00.000Z	david___		for gnu plot >.<
2009-06-18T04:27:00.000Z	Eevee	david___	for file in *.dat; do echo plot $file; done > outfile
2009-06-18T04:38:00.000Z	Eevee	david___	yes, the shell will consume the quotes.  you want to replace $file with "'$file'"
2009-06-18T04:39:00.000Z	Eevee	david___	single-quotes mean "everything in here is one argument and ignore all special characters".  double-quotes are the same but special characters are honored
