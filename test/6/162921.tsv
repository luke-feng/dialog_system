2004-10-27T07:32:00.000Z	yuval		Do you think ubuntu should show something like "Deiban menu" after you install a program that doesn't appear in gnome menu? Or always?
2004-10-27T07:32:00.000Z	arturaz	yuval	no, we don't need that
2004-10-27T07:34:00.000Z	yuval	arturaz	Way not? Don't  you think that a menu with all your apps in the system is more usefull than "About Ubuntu"?
2004-10-27T07:34:00.000Z	arturaz	yuval	users don't care about xeditres
2004-10-27T07:36:00.000Z	arturaz	yuval	kfoobar ain't gnome :P
2004-10-27T07:40:00.000Z	yuval	arturaz	prefer gnome too, but sometimes I want to use gvim, kde apps or other then gnome-games games...
