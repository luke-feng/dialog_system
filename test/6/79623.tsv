2008-01-23T02:19:00.000Z	nemilar	abo	you mean screenshots, or backups?
2008-01-23T02:19:00.000Z	abo	nemilar	screenshots
2008-01-23T02:19:00.000Z	nemilar	abo	just press your print screen key
2008-01-23T02:21:00.000Z	abo	nemilar	this captures the whole screen (or with alt+screenshot for a window) I want something more advanced where I can capture a given square or circle
2008-01-23T02:21:00.000Z	abo	nemilar	I know I could edit the photo.. but I'm trying to avoid that
