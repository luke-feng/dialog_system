2009-08-23T01:21:00.000Z	lanzelloth	asg	would you consider it to be powerfull?
2009-08-23T01:21:00.000Z	asg	lanzelloth	I consider it to be useful in a way that gnochm isn't.
2009-08-23T01:22:00.000Z	lanzelloth	asg	ok will try it out
2009-08-23T01:22:00.000Z	asg	lanzelloth	you can always apt-get remove --purge xchm if you don't like it :)
