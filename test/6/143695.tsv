2005-11-02T10:21:00.000Z	bimberi	freddy	nautilus (the file manager) can burn data cd's and isos
2005-11-02T10:21:00.000Z	freddy	mustard5	yeah, i saw that but i was thinking if that was like the windows xp one, and i wanted to see if there was something more reliable like easy cd creator like program
2005-11-02T10:22:00.000Z	freddy	mustard5	oh cool, recommendation?
2005-11-02T10:23:00.000Z	bimberi	freddy	nothing else by default, but you can install gnomebaker (or graveman or k3b)
