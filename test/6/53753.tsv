2008-07-31T19:55:00.000Z	willluongo	RainyLithuanian	and ask you to force
2008-07-31T19:56:00.000Z	RainyLithuanian	willluongo	I am newb, how can you check how are your partitions named?
2008-07-31T19:56:00.000Z	RainyLithuanian		I might guess that it's sd2 or smth, but I am not sure:)
2008-07-31T19:57:00.000Z	willluongo	RainyLithuanian	df -h will show you all of the partitions you are using (and their disk space)
