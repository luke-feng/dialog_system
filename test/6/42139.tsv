2009-02-24T07:17:00.000Z	Mike94287		Can someone please help me? I just got rid of Windows on my computer and now I'm running Ubuntu only. I want to run Ubuntu on my other computer as well, however I want to be able to login to the same user account on each computer. How would I go about doing that?

2009-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	Mike94287	kinja-sheep	And that would work for multiple user accounts correct, like if my sister also had a user account that she would like to access through either computer?
2009-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Mike94287	Not exactly. You'll have to install unison-gtk and sync the files/folder.  At prompt, it'll display the list of files/folders that will be sync between two machines at a time. You'll have to play with Unison to see what I mean by that.
2009-02-24T07:26:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Mike94287	Supposed I work on a file.  And I goes to my notebook.  I realized the file isn't updated.  I then run Unison and start syncing everything (new, last modified date, etc).  Then I work with the file.  It's possible that you set it up in session to auto-sync everything at login (rsync, I believe).
