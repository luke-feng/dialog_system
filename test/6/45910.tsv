2009-03-12T16:36:00.000Z	Slart	hothollas	not if it's new
2009-03-12T16:37:00.000Z	Slart	hothollas	if it already has files on it you might need to erase it.. not sure if it's called erase/format/clean or something else
2009-03-12T16:37:00.000Z	hothollas	Slart	it's not, but using brasero, it won't burn it without errors
2009-03-12T16:38:00.000Z	Slart	hothollas	might be something else.. hard to tell
2009-03-12T16:38:00.000Z	Slart	hothollas	shouldn't be
