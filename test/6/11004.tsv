2011-05-22T23:51:00.000Z	phaseshift	ssfdre38	You can't do 'sudo chown root:root /etc/sudoers'?
2011-05-22T23:51:00.000Z	ssfdre38	phaseshift	no its saying sudo: /etc/sudoers is owned by uid 1000, should be 0
2011-05-22T23:52:00.000Z	phaseshift	ssfdre38	Ah, okay ... now I understand.  I'd suggest you try rebooting in single-user mode (which drops you into a shell directly as root without authenticating or using sudo) and correcting the problem from there.

2011-05-22T23:55:00.000Z	phaseshift	ssfdre38	Ah, that's a bummer.  Any chance you have a network backup process like NetBackup that could push a valid /etc/sudoers (with correct ownership) over the LAN from tape or such?
