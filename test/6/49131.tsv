2008-10-31T01:47:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123		any help? My friend is getting kernel errors (or as he describes:  [NUMBERS]CODE LOCKERROR(OR SOMETHING) 769634(NUMBERS)) when booting up 8.04 live CD from his laptop
2008-10-31T01:48:00.000Z	wgrant	s0l1dsnak3123	I suggest trying the Ubuntu 8.10 live CD.
2008-10-31T01:48:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123	wgrant	Flare183: The CD is fine, I've used it many times
2008-10-31T01:49:00.000Z	s0l1dsnak3123	wgrant	Flare183: Possibly an ACPI error?
2008-10-31T01:49:00.000Z	wgrant	s0l1dsnak3123	Try Ubuntu 8.10 and see if it works.
