2009-04-22T01:02:00.000Z	Swede		Is there any script that will give me the feed by inserting the original url one by one from a text file?
2009-04-22T01:02:00.000Z	Swede		I want to collect feeds from different sites but I only have the url.
2009-04-22T01:03:00.000Z	Gnea	Swede	no, you need to go to the site and find the feed url for that site
2009-04-22T01:03:00.000Z	Gnea	Swede	just bookmark them into your bookmark bar until you have them all, then look at their properties in firefox
2009-04-22T01:22:00.000Z	Swede	Gnea	Are you sure? In Google Reader there i an option to add feed by entering the url, but then I have to add them one by one, I want to ad them as a list at once.
2009-04-22T01:23:00.000Z	Gnea	Swede	well, you'd need to collect the feeds into one area in order to ad them at once
