2005-07-06T10:08:00.000Z	selinium		HI all, my other halfs profile will not boot up properly... It start the gnome gui but stalls. My login is fine. Any ideas?
2005-07-06T10:08:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	selinium	 your boyfriend can't log in?
2005-07-06T10:09:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	selinium	 remove ~/.gnome{,2} from the login directory maybe, but that'll send gnome back to default settings
2005-07-06T10:09:00.000Z	selinium	bluefoxicy	I'm the boyfriend! goldfish, it is not a new install.
2005-07-06T10:10:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	selinium	 uh, oh, wait.  Forgot you could date girls.
2005-07-06T10:11:00.000Z	selinium	bluefoxicy	goldfish_: Now you have me confused! lol what do i type!
