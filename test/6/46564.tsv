2009-03-28T15:59:00.000Z	Squiggy_		Can I somehow erase ALL networks on Xchat?
2009-03-28T16:00:00.000Z	lukjad007	Squiggy_	How do you mean?
2009-03-28T16:00:00.000Z	lukjad007	Squiggy_	Oh. Sure!
2009-03-28T16:01:00.000Z	lukjad007	Squiggy_	In xchat Go to XChat->Network List
2009-03-28T16:02:00.000Z	lukjad007	Squiggy_	The select the one network you don't want, and press remove.
