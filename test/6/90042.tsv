2007-04-11T16:25:00.000Z	show_now_on	zero88	zonealarm for windows...what's your problem
2007-04-11T16:26:00.000Z	zero88	show_now_on	well i like it very much for my windows box because it restricts programs from running each time unless i give it access to.i was wondering if there was something like that for linux
2007-04-11T16:26:00.000Z	show_now_on	zero88	firestarter
2007-04-11T16:28:00.000Z	zero88	show_now_on	ya i know, i just dont really know how good it is.doesnt really seem like it does anything,but what i dont see doesnt mean its not working,anyway how could i get that to start everytime i boot up
2007-04-11T16:29:00.000Z	show_now_on	zero88	linux is alone is about as secure as anything...but firestarter for gnome gives you more customablities....i'm not sure how to start it from startup...but a click isn't all that hard
