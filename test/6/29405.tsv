2009-11-12T06:15:00.000Z	SunlessHalo		advice
2009-11-12T06:16:00.000Z	Samuli^	SunlessHalo	huh... since when has it included  that?
2009-11-12T06:17:00.000Z	Samuli^		how do you check what packages a meta-package will pull without installing it?
2009-11-12T06:17:00.000Z	SunlessHalo	Samuli^	afaik pretty long, it gives you an option wether to keep former driver or to install fglrx
2009-11-12T06:19:00.000Z	Samuli^	SunlessHalo	seems like it doesn't pull fglrx
