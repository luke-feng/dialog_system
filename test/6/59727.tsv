2008-04-27T07:01:00.000Z	SpectralDesign		<--- trying to do upgrade to 8.04 LTS, and the gui tool stalls at the first step: "fetching file 15 of 23"
2008-04-27T07:02:00.000Z	rich_freecomm	SpectralDesign	it is a bit slow
2008-04-27T07:03:00.000Z	SpectralDesign	rich_freecomm	okay, thanks, I'll try to be patient :P  I saw no network activity and tried a couple times so I thought maybe it was a bigger problem than me
2008-04-27T07:04:00.000Z	rich_freecomm	SpectralDesign	you could try a reboot of everything...Hubs, routers, modems, start fresh
2008-04-27T07:05:00.000Z	rich_freecomm	SpectralDesign	I let it run all night, I know I'd be anxious if I was awake while it was doing it :D
2008-04-27T07:05:00.000Z	SpectralDesign	rich_freecomm	roger - thanks again!  (yeah, good point... and I know it wont brick me like it may have done a couple years ago :)
