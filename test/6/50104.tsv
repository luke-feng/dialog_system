2008-09-29T02:15:00.000Z	beastax		hi, im having problem with fullscreen games, like ioUrbanTerror
2008-09-29T02:15:00.000Z	beastax		they keep jumping in and out of fullscreen
2008-09-29T02:15:00.000Z	beastax		has anyone else experienced this?
2008-09-29T02:16:00.000Z	dragonfi	beastax	are you using compiz? it can cause theese kind of problems( at least for me)
2008-09-29T02:17:00.000Z	beastax	dragonfi	yes, i had this exact same problem in fedora with compiz - but switching to metacity fixed it.  not in this case in ubunty (hardy)
2008-09-29T02:20:00.000Z	dragonfi	beastax	I use fusion-icon to change between compiz and metacity, but if the problem exist in metacity too I cannot help now( it's getting late here), good luck
