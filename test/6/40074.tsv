2009-03-26T01:03:00.000Z	sjzzalx		I mean, gksu instead of gksudo

2009-03-26T01:04:00.000Z	sjzzalx	LjL	That's nice to know, but I don't want my users to be able to execute things as root. I also want to be allowed to use the graphical utilities by piping through gksu instead of gksudo. How can this not be supported? Ubuntu is so crazy
