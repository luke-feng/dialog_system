2006-03-20T09:58:00.000Z	GnarusLeo	allievo_	it depends on if you have an encryption key to your wireless network
2006-03-20T09:58:00.000Z	GnarusLeo	allievo_	and wich WEP you set there
2006-03-20T09:59:00.000Z	GnarusLeo	allievo_	 HEX, ASCII or 128b
2006-03-20T09:59:00.000Z	allievo_	GnarusLeo	Ah, I was told that it was a difference in what kind of key you supplied. Thank you very much for your response!
