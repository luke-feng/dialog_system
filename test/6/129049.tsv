2012-09-16T14:46:00.000Z	Deutopia		if it is labeled casper-rw you want that
2012-09-16T14:48:00.000Z	Deutopia		if you want you can right click computer -> manage -> disk management -> delete and resize the fat, but but i would trust linux's gpararted more than i'd trust windows with partitioning a USB
