2009-09-12T23:24:00.000Z	anachronoks		But I did delete the partition.

2009-09-12T23:27:00.000Z	anachronoks	mezquitale	This was an ext3 partition, does that make any difference?
2009-09-12T23:29:00.000Z	mezquitale	anachronoks	it doesn't matter, unless your partition was encrypted, data can still be recovered from the partition, i suggest you wipe the hard drive so securely erase files
2009-09-12T23:29:00.000Z	anachronoks	mezquitale	Okay, will do that next time. Thanks
