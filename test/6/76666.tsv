2010-01-10T17:36:00.000Z	Yoman		When I type ifconfig, my ip etc isn't shown, but instead I am shown all my network devices. Why is this?
2010-01-10T17:36:00.000Z	llutz	Yoman	because that is ifconfigs job
2010-01-10T17:37:00.000Z	Yoman	llutz	ok, I just have this memory of using it before, and it showed me the same results that I get in windows when typing ipconfig /all
2010-01-10T17:40:00.000Z	Yoman	llutz	I am told that this is what ifconfig does http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6c/Ipconfig_win_xp.png but it doedn't do it for me
2010-01-10T17:40:00.000Z	llutz	Yoman	someone lied to you
