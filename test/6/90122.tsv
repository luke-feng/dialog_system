2007-04-08T09:21:00.000Z	lord1212		I am trying to run off the CD and noticed that GCC is here...but not G++ in the add remove list
2007-04-08T09:21:00.000Z	velko	lord1212	it's not rpm but deb. and the name is g++
2007-04-08T09:24:00.000Z	velko	lord1212	yes ram indeed
2007-04-08T09:29:00.000Z	velko	lord1212	i don't think the livecd has any root password. but i could be mistaken
2007-04-08T09:30:00.000Z	lord1212	velko	thats not true...when i sudo, it's not "blank"
