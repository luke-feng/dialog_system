2005-07-20T08:19:00.000Z	aarcane	wolki	as long as kubuntu isn't a completely different install medium, then yeah, I guess I have kubuntu
2005-07-20T08:20:00.000Z	wolki	aarcane	there is a different install medium (then you dont get the gnome stuff). but in the end they're the same
2005-07-20T08:21:00.000Z	aarcane	wolki	alright..  I have gnome stuff installed too on this biatch, I may take alot of it out..  problem is that with apt-get, dependancies are impossible..  because dependancies are just installed as regular packages....  >,.,<
