2009-04-24T06:24:00.000Z	ienorand	zopiac	mkfs?
2009-04-24T06:25:00.000Z	zopiac	ienorand	just mkfs /dev/xx?
2009-04-24T06:26:00.000Z	ienorand	zopiac	I am not sure, just a hunch that mkfs would be highly involved, looka at help and manual....
2009-04-24T06:26:00.000Z	zopiac	ienorand	ok, thanks...now i just have to figure out what this flash drive is listed under in /dev/ :P
