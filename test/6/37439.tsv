2011-01-09T06:35:00.000Z	EEMPHASISS		PS2 (PAL version) reports "TV system doesn't match."   Disk was created with "Dvd95 1.6p0" from PAL 6.4 GB original PAL disk down to 4.4 GB.
2011-01-09T06:37:00.000Z	Curly_Q	EEMPHASISS	perhaps the DVD disk is not compatible with the PAL System software.
2011-01-09T06:38:00.000Z	EEMPHASISS	Curly_Q	original disk is PAL - PAL is a format for TV Receivers
2011-01-09T06:40:00.000Z	EEMPHASISS	Curly_Q	original disk is PAL format, 6.4 GB.  Dvd95 produced a 4.4 GB disk: this disk is rejected by PS2 as "TV system doesn't match."
2011-01-09T06:43:00.000Z	Curly_Q	EEMPHASISS	it may be just a simple disk replacement such as a DVD-R    -N      or a Read Write issue and not a software issue.
2011-01-09T06:45:00.000Z	Curly_Q	EEMPHASISS	I was in a quandry after seeing all of the different disks and softwares to be installed and used.j
