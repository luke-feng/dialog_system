2011-02-19T06:44:00.000Z	JeffiPhone		Greetings, all.
2011-02-19T06:44:00.000Z	JeffiPhone		I've been using Ubuntu since Wednesday!
2011-02-19T06:46:00.000Z	JeffiPhone		But, Linux off and on since I don't remember when... Back when it was harder to get working, that's for sure. Ubuntu just works. It's like the Mac of Linux.

2011-02-19T06:49:00.000Z	Ben__437	JeffiPhone	CS runs great under wine now
