2005-02-09T13:55:00.000Z	apokryphos		Hi everyone. I know little about Linux, but I'm thinking of installing Ubuntu. What stuff do I need to know before plunging in with the installation?
2005-02-09T13:55:00.000Z	apokryphos		any links?
2005-02-09T13:56:00.000Z	hypn0	apokryphos	try the live cd
2005-02-09T13:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	hypn0	You don't think I should go straight in with the actual distro?
2005-02-09T13:57:00.000Z	hypn0	apokryphos	u could i guess, but theres a live cd, so why not try that before repartitioning
