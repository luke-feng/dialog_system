2010-05-04T02:06:00.000Z	fsaintjacques		I decided to upgrade from karmic to lucid, but while the updater was running, X died for an unknown reason. It died while dpkg was either unpacking or installing. Right now, the `lucid' process is still running. Is there any chance my update won't be trashed? I know from experience that the updater while wait for user input.
