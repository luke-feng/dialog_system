2012-02-17T21:38:00.000Z	malakian		so guys i got into ubuntu using the hold shift, selecting recovery mode method
2012-02-17T21:38:00.000Z	malakian		but im just updating it now via the auto update - is this likely to plug missing firmware?
2012-02-17T21:39:00.000Z	malakian		if not how do i find out what is missing and making it fail to start?
2012-02-17T21:41:00.000Z	malakian		*sigh*. is there a forum i can put my problem in
2012-02-17T21:41:00.000Z	malakian		as i'm not having much luck here
2012-02-17T21:41:00.000Z	LightHash	malakian	u should see my luck!
