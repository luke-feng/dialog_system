2009-03-23T12:42:00.000Z	Stefano	Schmick	thank u! But isn't a little older than Postfix or QMail?
2009-03-23T12:43:00.000Z	Schmick		yes, but if you need to teach how to configure pop3, it will do the job.
2009-03-23T12:43:00.000Z	Schmick		beside, in linux, old != bad
2009-03-23T12:43:00.000Z	Schmick		irc is still arround isn't it? :P
2009-03-23T12:46:00.000Z	Stefano	Schmick	ok, thank u.
