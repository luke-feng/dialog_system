2008-03-08T09:45:00.000Z	zulerdongle	vocx	i guess you could say that. i want the virtual machine to be accesible online from the outside like for example to have an ftp server, to use bittorrent correctly, etc etc

2008-03-08T09:48:00.000Z	zulerdongle	vocx	but i dont know how to do it.. with vmware i could select which network card to use for my virtual machine but with virtualbox i dont know
