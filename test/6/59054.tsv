2008-11-20T14:52:00.000Z	fde	monsoon_king	theoretically, just removing 'kubuntu-desktop' and running aptitude upgrade should get rid of everything
2008-11-20T14:53:00.000Z	fde	monsoon_king	aptitude purge kubuntu-desktop
2008-11-20T14:53:00.000Z	fde	monsoon_king	sudo that
2008-11-20T14:53:00.000Z	fde	monsoon_king	both will work... I just prefer aptitude
2008-11-23T14:58:00.000Z	fde	monsoon_king	ummm, no they're not, you're just using a faster mirror
