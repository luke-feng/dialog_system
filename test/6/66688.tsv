2008-09-22T13:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MonsieurBon	those cards will work in ubuntu, nvidia works great
2008-11-12T12:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MonsieurBon	do yuo mean booting a system from an ipod, or having ubuntu bootup on an ipod on the screen locally?
2008-11-12T12:47:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ActionParsnip	i'm talking about having a live system on my ipod.
2008-11-12T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MonsieurBon	oic, i guess you could. why you d want to is anyones guess. USB sticks are stupidly cheap now and at less risk to the more expensive ipod
2008-11-12T12:49:00.000Z	MonsieurBon	ActionParsnip	I have an ipod but no usbstick though! ^^
