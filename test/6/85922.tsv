2011-06-03T23:32:00.000Z	Duesentrieb_		anything i could turn on to find out what's happening?
2011-06-03T23:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Duesentrieb_	 while its running  ssh in, and have the log files being printed in real time.. untill it crashes. (use tail -f /var/log/SOMTHING)    and see what the logs say.
2011-06-03T23:33:00.000Z	Duesentrieb_	Dr_Willis	well... which log?...
2011-06-03T23:34:00.000Z	Duesentrieb_	Dr_Willis	as i said, the syslog doesn't have anything interesting...
