2008-03-12T06:55:00.000Z	Flannel	brandonc503	Because you can put stuff in that folder as your own user, without having to deal with permission issues inside of www-data
2008-03-12T06:55:00.000Z	Flannel	brandonc503	er, /var/www not www-data
2009-07-21T11:25:00.000Z	Flannel	brandonc503	Make /var/www owned by www-data:www-data, add yourself to the www-data group, and then add writing to group permissions
