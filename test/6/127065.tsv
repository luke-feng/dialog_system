2006-01-09T13:24:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CaptainMorgan	yes
2006-01-09T13:25:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CaptainMorgan	I know - it's a PITA, especially since sites like www.apple.com/trailers use .mov :S
2006-01-09T13:32:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CaptainMorgan	It is a POS, and I only use it for .mov files ^_^
2006-01-09T13:32:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	PuMpErNiCkLe	am I missing something? because it can't play them..
2006-01-09T13:34:00.000Z	PuMpErNiCkLe	CaptainMorgan	o_O
