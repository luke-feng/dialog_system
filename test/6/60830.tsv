2010-11-12T19:16:00.000Z	jubei		as far as I know ubuntu had a text-install wizard
2010-11-12T19:16:00.000Z	DJones	jubei	You may be better trying xubuntu which has a lower hardware requirement
2010-11-12T19:16:00.000Z	jubei		ok i'll try the minimal then, thanks!
2010-11-12T19:17:00.000Z	jubei		anyway, despite that .Didn't ubuntu have a non-graphical installation wizard? I'm pretty sure it did. in the main cd
2010-11-12T19:17:00.000Z	DJones	jubei	The alternate install cd uses a classic text mode installer if that helps
2010-11-12T19:17:00.000Z	jubei	DJones	kk thank you
