2012-10-09T04:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis		You could tweak the command in that factoid to make a simple list.  but DONT use aptitude to install stuff like the 2nd half says.
2012-10-09T04:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis		we need a better clone factoid someday. ;)
2012-10-09T04:42:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Dr_willis	you can revise the factoid yourself ;)
2012-10-09T04:42:00.000Z	Dr_willis	actionParsnip	 i  just reinstall stuff as i need  :) that way i end up not reinstlling cruft
2012-10-09T04:43:00.000Z	actionParsnip	Dr_willis	could use puppet :)
