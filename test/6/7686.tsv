2012-04-05T11:25:00.000Z	auronandace	djszapi	should work, not sure about the gobi 2000 mobile broadband or the intel graphics though
2012-04-05T11:25:00.000Z	djszapi	auronandace	yep, just checked out a youtube video, and looks good.
2012-04-05T11:26:00.000Z	auronandace	djszapi	depends how new the intel graphics is, also the specs don't mention if it uses sandy bridge
2012-04-05T12:06:00.000Z	djszapi	auronandace	do you think it is worth spending more money for an emperorlinux supported toughbook, or I can manually get ubuntu work ? I have ten years of linux experience and strong programming background.
2012-04-05T12:06:00.000Z	djszapi	auronandace	but I have never dealt with this question in topic. However installing linux nowadays is easy-peasy. I guess touch is not really a problem either nowadays, nor the keyboard.
2012-04-05T12:07:00.000Z	djszapi	auronandace	perhaps the graphics stack, or something else ?
