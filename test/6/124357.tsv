2006-03-01T13:52:00.000Z	iBalo	linda019	if you tell the installer to do so, yes
2006-03-01T13:53:00.000Z	iBalo	linda019	but it migt be a good idea to prepare some diskspace beforehand
2006-03-01T13:55:00.000Z	linda019	iBalo	so i should use my partition magic to set up partition, i have 69 g's with lots of free space left
