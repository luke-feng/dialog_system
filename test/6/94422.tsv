2009-09-07T04:40:00.000Z	Pici	deinspanjer	The release numbers are YY.MM
2009-09-07T04:40:00.000Z	deinspanjer	Pici	Ah, well that clarifies things then. :)
2009-09-07T04:44:00.000Z	Pici	deinspanjer	'proper server' is a very vague term.  Commerical companies don't want to upgrade their servers upgraded every 6 months, which is why we have an LTS release.
2009-09-07T04:49:00.000Z	deinspanjer	Pici	Keep in mind, I'm not necessarily wanting to keep anything around from the desktop install.  I'm happy to end up with a fresh clean server install.
