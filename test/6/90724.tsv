2007-03-31T05:06:00.000Z	rickcr		I can't decide if I want to use gnome or kde, been messing with both of them.. one thing that seems to bother me is in kde, the spacing often between lines is too great. for example in Eclipse the line spacing between class names on the left, and now i just started xchat and there is so much space between nicks.
2007-03-31T05:06:00.000Z	rickcr		is there a way to change this spacing?
2007-03-31T05:06:00.000Z	rickcr		hmm maybe. ill try another theme to see if helps.
2007-03-31T05:07:00.000Z	rickcr		well it's not just xchat is what i'm saying.
2007-03-31T05:07:00.000Z	plb_	rickcr	i think spacing is a theme thing
