2009-11-20T18:46:00.000Z	dooglus	jcrawford	I didn't play anything at all.  I ran rhythmbox.  it scans my music on startup even if I don't ask it to play anything
2009-11-20T18:47:00.000Z	jcrawford	dooglus	ah that makes sense if it is scanning upon launch
2009-11-20T18:47:00.000Z	jcrawford		yea someone should submit a patch for that :)
2009-11-20T18:48:00.000Z	dooglus	jcrawford	I don't think scanning on launch is a bug
2009-11-20T18:49:00.000Z	jcrawford	dooglus	no scanning on launch is not a bug but it should ignore filetypes it does not recognize I would consider that to be a bug
