2009-02-22T21:27:00.000Z	mikebeecham		Hi guys,
2009-02-22T21:27:00.000Z	mikebeecham		Something quite strange has happened to my notification area.  It's there, but there are not minimized tasks on there.  I've tried adding a new notification area, a new panel with new notification area, I've restarted X, rebooted the machine...nothing. It's just not working.
2009-02-22T21:27:00.000Z	mikebeecham		Can anyone suggest anything else I might try.
