2010-07-05T15:57:00.000Z	imgx64		Bash question: I have files that have spaces in their names, "for i in *" processes these files as two (example: "file one" as "file" and "one"), how do I make it treat them as one file?

2010-07-05T15:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	imgx64	for file in *; do ... "$file" ...; done
