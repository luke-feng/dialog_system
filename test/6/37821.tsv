2009-05-25T03:30:00.000Z	koshari1	amseidler	as kalmi said use the ubuntu live disc to copy individual files,
2009-05-25T03:38:00.000Z	koshari1	amseidler	open gparted and see what partition, filesystem they are then mount it
2009-05-25T03:38:00.000Z	koshari1	amseidler	or alternatively use fdisk -l
2009-05-25T03:39:00.000Z	amseidler	koshari1	Ok, it's already mounted
2009-05-25T03:39:00.000Z	koshari1	amseidler	then just use nautilus to browse it
