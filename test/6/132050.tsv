2007-02-13T08:21:00.000Z	LjL	CrakeHunter	if the file is owned by root, delete it as root (though this begs the question, why would you delete a root owned file?)
2007-02-15T09:21:00.000Z	LjL	CrakeHunter	yes. however, the opposite is true as well: everybody can look at the source, so there are many eyes that can *spot* backdoors and report them quickly, so that they can be fixed ASAP. on closed-source, you can have backdoors unspotted for ages
