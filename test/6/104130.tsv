2007-02-27T12:19:00.000Z	chivosolar	ikonia	so havin some strange side effect, i rebooted and the computer browser shows the two usb partions as drives but complains that only root can mount the device; ls -al /media shows that the directory is owned by root root  and the main drive directories are owned by   root plugdev
