2008-11-10T11:11:00.000Z	ectospasm		how do I install g++?  I can't seem to search for it with aptitude, and it doesn't appear to be part of the pre-installed gcc set
2008-11-10T11:12:00.000Z	Flannel	ectospasm	install build-essential

2009-03-04T11:44:00.000Z	Flannel	ectospasm	For the record, that sort of view is not welcome here.  If you don't know the answer, either look it up, or let somene else handle the issue.  RTFM (and others like it) are not welcome, period.

2010-11-01T13:36:00.000Z	ectospasm	Flannel	Oh, I must be mistaken then
