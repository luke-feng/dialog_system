2012-05-18T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	ruli	why is that ?
2012-05-18T19:20:00.000Z	ruli	ikonia	well they're not exactly the sharpest tools in the toolbox
2012-05-18T19:21:00.000Z	ikonia	ruli	yet they make and maintain and ubuntu disto which is pretty much the most popular desktop on the linux platform,
2012-05-18T19:21:00.000Z	ikonia	ruli	I'd suggest keeping your ill thought comments to yourself
2012-05-18T19:21:00.000Z	ruli	ikonia	yeah good luck with that
