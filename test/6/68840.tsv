2008-05-10T01:01:00.000Z	Dynos		i mean its far beyond reason to include ff3 in a stable release
2008-05-10T01:01:00.000Z	Dynos		since its beta
2008-05-10T01:02:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Dynos	LTS releases are future-facing, since the software is going to be in use for a long time.
2008-05-10T01:02:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Dynos	If the beta software in Ubuntu doesn't live up to your expectations, just ask for a refund, no problem.
2008-05-10T01:03:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Dynos	Nobody has a finished FF3 yet. The guys and gals at Mozilla are still hashing that out.
