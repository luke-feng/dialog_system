2005-02-24T14:51:00.000Z	SeanQ		Question.
2005-02-24T14:52:00.000Z	SeanQ		Somehow, my Rhythmbox stops loading songs..[I have a library of about 1000 over 2 folders]  but still says Loading Songs..?
2005-02-24T14:52:00.000Z	SeanQ		How can I get these songs to load?
2005-02-24T14:52:00.000Z	SeanQ		I tried to --debug it but to no avail
2005-02-24T14:52:00.000Z	cowbud	SeanQ	sometimes just letting it sit there for a long time it will eventually stop..
2005-02-24T14:53:00.000Z	SeanQ	cowbud	I don't want it to stop, though..I want it to keep loading songs
