2007-04-13T09:27:00.000Z	roland_		as main desktop
2007-04-13T09:27:00.000Z	AlexC_	roland_	yes,
2007-04-13T09:28:00.000Z	AlexC_	roland_	I had to reinstall it this morning though, as latest updates meant I couldn't boot ... so I still would not reccomend it for main desktop
2007-04-13T09:28:00.000Z	roland_	AlexC_	: but i can skip updating until official and final fesity release is out and only then update once and for all
2007-04-13T09:28:00.000Z	AlexC_	roland_	yes, thats what I'm doing now - I have a notification telling me to upgrade, but I'm not doing it :P
