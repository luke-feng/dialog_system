2009-03-16T00:00:00.000Z	jjshoe		I'm after tmda, but it doesn't have a package for intrepid
2009-03-16T00:00:00.000Z	vocx	jjshoe	what is that? Find out why it was obsoleted.

2009-03-16T00:02:00.000Z	vocx	jjshoe	install from source. Packages have dependency information, so the package manager may go nuts trying to install versions that aren't available, but it is also not a big deal, unless it overwrites dependencies.
