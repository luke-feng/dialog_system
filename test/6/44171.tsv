2009-02-27T16:44:00.000Z	Huffameg	kinja-sheep	that's what i'm trying to do.. i've put adblock on disable for all myspace pages but the player still doesn't work..

2009-02-27T16:46:00.000Z	Huffameg	kinja-sheep	yes, i just did that i found out that it was an adblock problem.. when i'm disabling the whole plugin everything works, but when i try an exception for one page or one site it doesn't work.. that is, it works for the ads but not for the myspace-player..
2009-02-27T16:47:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	Huffameg	Myspace is an ad.  There you go. :)
2009-02-27T16:47:00.000Z	Huffameg	kinja-sheep	haha.. yep..
