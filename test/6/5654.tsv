2012-08-13T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Calahan	could be your .bashrc or somthing is starting a second login shell
2012-08-14T21:02:00.000Z	Calahan	Dr_Willis	i mean i want it to be fixed to user login name is that possible?
2012-08-14T21:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Calahan	thought thats how they normslly work. identd is simthing i find useless these days
2012-08-16T00:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Calahan	rsync and cron
