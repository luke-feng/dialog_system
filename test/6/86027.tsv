2009-04-09T05:42:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Guest41235	install compizconfig-settings-manager and fiddle with the settings
2009-04-09T05:43:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Guest41235	it will add an entry in System > Preferences where you can change all the setings for compiz
2009-04-09T05:44:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	Guest41235	ctrl + alt + right or left arrow
