2010-11-12T03:29:00.000Z	EpicCyndaquil		I have a computer with about 300MB RAM, any tips for speeding up Ubuntu? Should I look into a different window manager?
2010-11-12T03:30:00.000Z	EpicCyndaquil		alright, I'll check out lubuntu
2010-11-12T03:31:00.000Z	EpicCyndaquil		any difference between lubuntu and Ubuntu other than window manager?
2010-11-12T03:32:00.000Z	EpicCyndaquil		do you think if I grabbed Ubuntu Server and threw a window manager on top of it, it would run much lighter?
