2009-11-30T03:08:00.000Z	Snausages	capon	have you tried enabling it from the network tool?
2009-11-30T03:09:00.000Z	Snausages	capon	try right-clicking on the network tool in the menu bar, see if it says wireless disabled and hit the checkbox to enable it again
2009-11-30T03:11:00.000Z	Snausages	capon	something else is wrong then.  It used to work? what has changed?
