2010-04-09T18:26:00.000Z	maginot	kernel_geek	X11 now auto configures your X server ,so only create a xorg.conf if you need some special
2010-04-09T18:26:00.000Z	kernel_geek		this annoys me, what reason would they have to take it away other than "they can"
2010-04-09T18:27:00.000Z	kernel_geek	maginot	So I can just add sections I need, I dont need to right a whole config ?
2010-04-09T18:27:00.000Z	maginot	kernel_geek	you can see what your X11 is using reading /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-04-09T18:28:00.000Z	maginot	kernel_geek	yes you can just add the section you need, indeed. If you needa full xorg.conf use X -configure
