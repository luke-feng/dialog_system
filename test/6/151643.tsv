2005-04-10T14:43:00.000Z	Flonne		Probably because the devs want to have everything ready for the actual release.
2005-04-10T14:43:00.000Z	Flonne		April 8th.
2005-04-10T14:44:00.000Z	mrproper	Flonne	How long after the release does it take to get a new dev branch setup?
2005-04-10T14:44:00.000Z	Flonne		Releases are scheduled to occur every six months.
2005-04-10T14:44:00.000Z	mrproper	Flonne	But to get a new dev branch open after Horay goes stable, does it take a week or is it pretty much that day?
2005-04-10T14:46:00.000Z	Flonne	mrproper	I can't say for certain.
