2012-07-04T13:51:00.000Z	bent-stack	Dr_willis	"4o inch TV monitor" = does it look low res? was thinking of getting one myself..
2012-07-04T13:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bent-stack	 when you are sitting 2 ft in front of it.. its not idea for 'work' but i use it for games mainly.
2012-07-04T13:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bent-stack	 and  i had to work with the monitor settings under linux and windows and on the tv. to get the overscan stuff disabled. or i lost part of the display off the edges.
2012-07-04T13:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis		AND the tv has so many fancy 'movie viewing' features. its constantly diming/changeing colors when it shouldent (when using  a desktop/work) that its annoying. But for movies/games - its great.
2012-07-04T13:54:00.000Z	bent-stack		Ok - I looked into pulling apart some 22inch LCD's to make a micro bezel between them
2012-07-04T13:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	bent-stack	 so over all.. for doing 'work' - a decent computer monitor would be best. I have seen newer monitors with very very small bezels.  and higher res then the tvs.
