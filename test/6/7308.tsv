2011-10-26T08:53:00.000Z	phalanx101		DId you use Wubi to install I'm assuming, AM)?
2011-10-26T08:54:00.000Z	phalanx101		That's it then...
2011-10-26T08:54:00.000Z	phalanx101		From what I remember at least. Look at the install size. Also, ther is an Ubuntu folder in your C drive, correct? I'm referring to Wubi being your ubuntu install...
2011-10-26T08:56:00.000Z	phalanx101		Ok, you should be able to uninstall it by removing the wubi program from control panel. However, IDK if this will mess up your GRUB bootloader though... can't remember from the last time I messed around with Wubi...
