2008-06-03T02:41:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I still need to figure out why I can't shutdown properly in kubuntu.
2008-06-03T02:41:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I do not like forcing a hard shutdown
2008-06-03T02:41:00.000Z	danbhfive	JuJuBee	have you tried going to one of the ttyts?  like 1 6 or 8?
2008-06-03T02:42:00.000Z	danbhfive	JuJuBee	I think that ttyt 6 has all the shutdown messages
