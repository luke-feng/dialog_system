2011-07-08T11:55:00.000Z	pilsbury	cousin_mario	unity sucks, use classic and install compiz... the effects are better and unity does eff up your system in the meantime
2011-07-08T11:56:00.000Z	cousin_mario	pilsbury	classic won't last forever, so I'm looking into how to make unity somewhat more acceptable
2011-07-08T11:59:00.000Z	pilsbury	cousin_mario	i bet there will always be a classic version until unity doesn't conflict as much with your desktop, though. So until it's way more stable, there will be a classic version, and after it happens we wont need classic anymore
