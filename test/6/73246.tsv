2007-12-01T12:37:00.000Z	dns53	gRnt	logout/login
2007-12-01T12:38:00.000Z	gRnt	dns53	I havent had to do that yet how do I log out heh. save restarting the os ofcourse
2007-12-01T12:39:00.000Z	dns53	gRnt	the problem is you do not have all the shell environment variables setup, a logout/login or running bash to create a sub shell may work
