2006-07-27T06:33:00.000Z	Grue_Lovah		I'm trying to print a PDF.  I tried sudo apt-get install cups-pdf but something didn't work
2006-07-27T06:34:00.000Z	Grue_Lovah		systematicdub: nyet. I haven't tried this, yet.
2006-07-27T06:35:00.000Z	Grue_Lovah		right - sorry. that's what I want. to create a pdf :-)
2006-07-27T06:36:00.000Z	RadiantFire	Grue_Lovah	you sholdn't need cups-pdf, I think support for that is already available without that package
2006-07-27T06:37:00.000Z	RadiantFire	Grue_Lovah	the default gnome print dialogs often have to pdf option
2006-07-27T06:37:00.000Z	RadiantFire	Grue_Lovah	and OpenOffice has it internally imiplemented
