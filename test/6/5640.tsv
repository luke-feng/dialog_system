2012-03-18T15:41:00.000Z	Onkeltem		Hi all. I want to create multiboot USB pendrive. What would you recommend for that? I'm on Ubuntu. I want to create a USB pendrive with different operating systems, tools, tests etc

2012-03-18T15:45:00.000Z	Onkeltem	apple_cat	well, I'm sure there is some ready-to-use solutions
