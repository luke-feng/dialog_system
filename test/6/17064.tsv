2010-10-05T19:39:00.000Z	magnetron	kristiina	i think most flashing tools require a version of DOS
2010-10-05T19:41:00.000Z	kristiina	magnetron	the file i downloaded from hp site is .exe (dos/windows). i don't want to install windows just to update the bios:( is there any way around it?
2010-10-05T19:42:00.000Z	magnetron	kristiina	you could use a FreeDOS live CD or boot floppy
2010-10-05T19:52:00.000Z	kristiina		magetron: OK. i don't have a cddrive but usbstick i have.
