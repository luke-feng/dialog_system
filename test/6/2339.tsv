2012-08-12T22:11:00.000Z	alecjw		i've tried changing the "connector" option in sound settings to internal mic with no success
2012-08-12T22:11:00.000Z	alecjw		it used to work but it's stopped now
2012-08-12T22:12:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	alecjw	you have checked in sound that it is not off?
2012-08-12T22:12:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		or turned down
2012-08-12T22:12:00.000Z	alecjw	wilee-nilee	yup. it's at a sensible volume and not muted
