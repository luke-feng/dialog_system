2008-01-29T09:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	guest22	looks fine from my end
2008-01-29T09:48:00.000Z	guest22	Scunizi	Nothing strange at all? For example, on the top level page, I see "Delete packages erom yotr PPA" and "Branch eeeds".
2008-01-29T09:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	guest22	nope.. looks very normal
2008-01-29T09:50:00.000Z	guest22	Scunizi	Strange, must be some local configuration issue. Thanks.
