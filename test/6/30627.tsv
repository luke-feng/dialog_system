2012-08-19T02:17:00.000Z	ChogyDan	violinappren	ok, but please don't ask for details if you can't help.  I just don't know which command I should use to configure, debian/rules editconfigs or debian/rules updateconfigs.  I also don't know how to check if I have configured correctly.  I feel lost

2012-08-19T02:18:00.000Z	ChogyDan	violinappren	I know how it works -.-
2012-08-19T02:19:00.000Z	violinappren	ChogyDan	not if you withhold the details from public :)
