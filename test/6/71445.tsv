2007-12-04T04:29:00.000Z	ompaul	RuanE_	you got some kind of proxy on your network, cos you are sure showing the symptoms of i
2007-12-04T04:30:00.000Z	RuanE_	ompaul	I will shut off all other machines on the network to eliminate the problem
2007-12-04T04:32:00.000Z	ompaul	RuanE_	if the firewall only passes info from the proxy server then you got issues - you need to know more about your network than just assuming that is the case, check out the web browser settings on two other machines and look for proxy settings
2007-12-04T04:34:00.000Z	RuanE_	ompaul	This is a relativley simple home network, it has 4 machines, on none of which have ever needed a proxy server, I can traceroute absolutley fine, and I can see that it just goes straight out of the router, onto the interner
2007-12-04T04:36:00.000Z	ompaul	RuanE_	and if you turn off all other machines reboot yours - if the problem goes away it is your router that needs to be told to hand out more ips and so forth
