2009-07-09T04:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dijonmustard	I have used VMware player and server before,  but Virtualbox :)
2009-07-09T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dijonmustard	Virtualbox is amazing :)
2009-07-09T04:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dijonmustard	I read it's slow with some games though, or whatever
2009-07-09T04:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dijonmustard	yep it's getting there,  with the help of Wine, and  Virtualbox
2009-07-09T04:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dijonmustard	of course there are some pretty good games for Linux,  just got to know where to get them from,   but  there's still this idea that  Windows gaming is  better, so once  Virtualbox can support it properly :)
