2011-09-22T16:22:00.000Z	Amdpc	ActionParsnip	: Is it also possible to make partitions of the fs which I am currently using (fs where Ubuntu is installed)?
2011-09-25T22:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amdpc	is it before grub loads?
2011-09-25T22:06:00.000Z	Amdpc	ActionParsnip	: No . When I my ubuntu starts up..ie after I enter my login password.
2011-09-25T22:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amdpc	read through:  dmesg | less      it may give clues
2011-09-25T22:10:00.000Z	Amdpc	ActionParsnip	: Thanks :)
2011-11-01T10:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Amdpc	could look at the create time of the /home folder or something like that
