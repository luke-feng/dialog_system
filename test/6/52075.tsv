2010-02-01T12:23:00.000Z	bullgard	nomad77	For what should I check it?
2010-02-01T12:24:00.000Z	nomad77	bullgard	your bug-report?,maybe i misunderstood.
2010-02-01T12:24:00.000Z	bullgard	nomad77	Do you consider that I will find my lost bug report there?
2010-02-01T12:28:00.000Z	nomad77	bullgard	well it was a web form. so i'd look there, just to be safe. try the cache-viewer extension. or not. just an idea.
2010-03-01T12:46:00.000Z	nomad77	bullgard	use "verbose slash=silent" maybe? w/o the quotes. worked in old grub.
