2007-03-18T15:49:00.000Z	peepsalot		does anyone know why Totem can't(and never could) play a damn thing on my computer?
2007-03-18T15:49:00.000Z	peepsalot		mplayer seems to work, which would suggest that I have the codecs installed.
2007-03-18T15:50:00.000Z	peepsalot		i'm so sick of it
2007-03-18T15:51:00.000Z	peepsalot		i just don't understand why totem is the default player, when it doesn't seem capable of _doing anything_.  Am I the only person with this problem
2007-03-18T15:52:00.000Z	peepsalot		if i didn't have the codecs, wouldn't mplayer not work either?
