2010-09-08T19:33:00.000Z	Patero-ng		mmy question hasn't get answered hopefuly someone hears knows quite quiet
2010-09-08T19:34:00.000Z	Patero-ng		I want to know if ubuntu is more secure then windows for seeing ur secret data such as bank or ebay, paypal
2010-09-08T19:34:00.000Z	th0r	Patero-ng	there is nothing in linux that is special about the link between you and internet sites, so no....it isn't more secure
2010-09-08T19:35:00.000Z	th0r	Patero-ng	you didn't ask about linux being more secure than windows...you asked about using ebay, bank, etc. The OS is more secure, the network link is not
2010-09-08T19:37:00.000Z	th0r	Patero-ng	it would be much harder for linux to fall victim to a drive-by keylogger infection or such as that, yes. The design of the OS pretty much precludes the sort of infections windows encounters
