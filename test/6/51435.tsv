2009-02-28T08:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	storbeck	true..
2009-02-28T08:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	storbeck	ditto

2009-03-11T19:41:00.000Z	storbeck	Scunizi	His reboot is hanging though, so I don't think it would close out screen
2009-03-11T19:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	storbeck	depends on if it hangs on the shutdown side or the boot side.. > bhsx
