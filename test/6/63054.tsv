2008-06-19T04:27:00.000Z	chowder	jrib	but is it a live CD? because I don't know if it'll detect my wireless connection
2008-06-19T04:28:00.000Z	jrib	chowder	no, use a wired connection for the install if you have issues
2008-06-19T04:28:00.000Z	chowder	jrib	erm....that's not really possible
2008-06-19T04:29:00.000Z	jrib	chowder	is that what you want?
2008-06-19T04:29:00.000Z	chowder	jrib	a custom liveCD would do the trick
