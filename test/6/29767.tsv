2010-05-01T19:22:00.000Z	qcjn2		just using openssh server
2010-05-01T19:23:00.000Z	danielsevigny	qcjn2	using SSH he'll be able to see everything. Just make sure it's not writable.
2010-05-01T19:24:00.000Z	qcjn2	danielsevigny	ok, thanks. Since it s someone i trust , i ll just tell him to stay in his home directory
2010-05-01T19:25:00.000Z	qcjn2	danielsevigny	but i ll know for a next time , not to use ssh for that
2010-05-01T19:26:00.000Z	qcjn2	danielsevigny	thanks, have a nice day
