2011-05-01T14:20:00.000Z	Alarcron		Hello, this question has probably been asked since the worlds conception... However. Switcable GPUs. Has it been implemented yet? I seriously can not leave windows until tht has been properly fixed! :S
2011-05-01T14:22:00.000Z	Alarcron		Herbs ya...
2011-05-01T14:23:00.000Z	Alarcron		Herbs well actually... not to start a flame war or anything. Win7 really dont have to reboot more then when updating the internals so to speak ;) but i prefer ubuntu non the less.
2011-05-01T14:25:00.000Z	Alarcron		well, sure it askes for a reboot from time to time... Like certain bigger updates. But, well, it can simply wait until you turn it off for. Well, the next time.
2011-05-01T14:26:00.000Z	Alarcron		however, i believe ive got the answer i was looking for. = To wait for a kernel update. So youll see me again when thats been fixed. See you
