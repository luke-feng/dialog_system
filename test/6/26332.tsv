2010-02-09T11:14:00.000Z	mobius2		is it possible to launch a game from terminal  and control the maximum  resolution the program is allowed to envoke this way?
2010-02-09T11:14:00.000Z	mobius2		is there a standard way of doing some thing like that or would it be specific to the game?
2010-02-09T11:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mobius2	The game probably has a flag to set the resolution, if you *really* need to you can use a nested X server like xephyr to force it to a separate window, which you can then make full screen and control as you wish, but that's almost certainly overkill

2011-03-26T05:44:00.000Z	mobius2	Jordan_U	 I  recently installed a copy of windows to a computer,  now the new windows instance boots ,  grub boot loader does not appear at all. I do understand why, but I am a bit reluctant to make edits to the boot loader. Is there a way to convey to you the location of the p[artitions on my hard drive so that you might be able to help me make the edits to the grud config file?
