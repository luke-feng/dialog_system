2009-03-22T20:24:00.000Z	jase_		i have a few issues i need to address 1) when i plug a nokia 5610 in and set to datastorage it pops up an error about not mounting properly but continues to mount. i can delete from it but cannot copy anything to it nor move anything around on it
2009-03-22T20:25:00.000Z	jase_		2) monitor shuts off after a while during full screen games like nexuis and saubertan, even though i am using the mouse and keyboard
2009-03-22T20:25:00.000Z	jase_		3) firefox tends to become unresponsive after opening only 5 tabs
