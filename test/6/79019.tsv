2008-07-06T01:29:00.000Z	Refefer		Hey there, having an installation issue with ubuntu
2008-07-06T01:29:00.000Z	Refefer		I think it's installing it's bootloader onto the wrong hd
2008-07-06T01:30:00.000Z	Refefer		and thus, after I reboot, it loads up Windows XP
2008-07-06T01:30:00.000Z	Refefer		and does not give me the option
2008-07-06T01:30:00.000Z	dbmoodb	Refefer	during the installation you can pick which one (hard disk to install too) last time i installed if i remmeber correctly --if that doesn't work you can just disconnect / disable in bios the second / other drives
2008-07-06T01:34:00.000Z	dbmoodb	Refefer	in the installer ....
