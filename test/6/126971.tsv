2006-01-10T17:55:00.000Z	nagyv		Hello! I have a problem with my pcmcia wireless card. It is recognized in the Network Settings, but I can not enable it. Before it was working properly, and I don't know about anything special, that could harm it. Could someone help me, how to find out the source of the problem?
