2009-07-12T18:34:00.000Z	noobe		can anyone help me ? I would like to generate a list of installed packages (this I already made )   ,  and redownload the packages I have installed from that list.  Just download
2009-07-12T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	noobe	dpkg -l generates the list, then do a while loop to apt-get them on the next install
2009-07-12T18:35:00.000Z	noobe	ikonia	but that way they will install again .... :(
2009-07-12T18:35:00.000Z	noobe		I would just like to download them
