2009-07-18T08:37:00.000Z	skyeee		alright, i'm trying to enable dual monitors in my gfx settings (nvidia) and when i hit save to x it says that it's unable to create a back of xorg.conf so it doesn't save it
2009-07-18T08:37:00.000Z	bastidrazor	skyeee	in terminal type  gksudo nvidia-settings  ..that will allow you to save to xorg.conf
2009-07-18T08:37:00.000Z	bastidrazor	skyeee	then restart X after you've made the changes. all set
2009-07-18T08:38:00.000Z	skyeee	bastidrazor	thanks
2009-07-18T08:38:00.000Z	skyeee	bastidrazor	what's the command for that again? ctrl alt backspace seems to be disabled, and it's been a few years since using linux :/
2009-07-18T08:38:00.000Z	bastidrazor	skyeee	alt + sysrq + k
