I'm going to dual boot with win7, I want to have a large shared partition with my home directory in it. Is this a good idea? Also, what's a good filesytem to share with windows7? Are the ubuntu ntfs drivers any good these days, how about ext4 drivers for windows?

2010-06-06T18:02:00.000Z	AlmostObsolete	ActionParsnip	thanks, probably better to be safe than sorry :]
