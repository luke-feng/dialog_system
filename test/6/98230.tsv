2008-09-21T15:11:00.000Z	nevagonnagiveuup		I heard that its lame using it with windows, even if you like it
2008-09-21T15:11:00.000Z	nevagonnagiveuup		wubi that was I mean
2008-09-21T15:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nevagonnagiveuup	i've never sued Wubi, but I've heard its OK.. but i wouldn't use it in Vmware... I'd install it in some fashion
2008-09-21T15:13:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	nevagonnagiveuup	ok, thats ridiculous, you can still install Ubuntu...
