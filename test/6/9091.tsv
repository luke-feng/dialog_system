2011-06-02T05:55:00.000Z	trans	sabiancrash_cgx	its new system, just don't wanna break it so early
2011-06-02T05:55:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx	trans	hence the disk image
2011-06-02T05:57:00.000Z	sabiancrash_cgx	trans	the other option is to use ubuntu in a virtualbox VM
2011-06-02T05:57:00.000Z	trans	sabiancrash_cgx	thanks for the information
