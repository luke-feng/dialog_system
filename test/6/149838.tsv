2008-08-03T08:10:00.000Z	nickrud	mi1	get the driver from fs-driver.org
2008-08-03T08:10:00.000Z	nickrud	mi1	yes, ubuntu uses a different file system than windows. You need to add the driver for it to XP
2008-08-03T08:12:00.000Z	nickrud	mi1	yes, it does matter. Windows simply can't read the linux filesystem without an extra driver
2008-08-03T08:16:00.000Z	nickrud	mi1	yes. You should read that page completely, so you know it's limitations. Me, I generally only read from ntfs in linux, and from ext in windows. Try never to write to either from either
2008-08-03T08:17:00.000Z	nickrud	mi1	its much safer now than it used to be, I'm just very conservative
