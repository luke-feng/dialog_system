2009-11-19T05:23:00.000Z	DasEi2	lucas__	purge and re-install ?
2009-11-19T05:24:00.000Z	lucas__	DasEi2	but is there no command line to do that else purge and re-install ?
2009-11-19T05:25:00.000Z	DasEi2	lucas__	most is iptables - based , which ruleset you can flush, depends on app, but doN#t ask me if this is the default-config
2009-11-19T05:28:00.000Z	lucas__	DasEi2	cause today i had to purge a program and re-install. I was curious if there is any command line to do that
2009-11-19T05:29:00.000Z	DasEi2	lucas__	f.e. sudo apt-get remove --purge ufw && sudo apt-get install ufw   will do so
