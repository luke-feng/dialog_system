2006-12-19T10:02:00.000Z	paranoia16		is fedora core 6 as easy to use as ubuntu?
2006-12-19T10:04:00.000Z	paranoia16		well, i was thinking of switching to is because i think it supports lightscribe
2006-12-19T10:04:00.000Z	paranoia16		is it supposed to support lightscibe? on the lightscribe.com, it has a .rpm, so fedora supports it, right?
