2007-09-21T15:58:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	jacob	what is the problems you have with your wireless?
2007-09-21T16:02:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	jacob	i would look elsewhere since you already know of a scenario when it is working. for example, you may need merely to disable wep encryption when connecting at the library
2007-09-21T16:04:00.000Z	WaltzingAlong	jacob	i am not proposing you go without ndiswrapper but if with ndiswrapper you can connect using wep then ndiswrapper is likely not the cause of the problems at the library
