2011-09-16T03:06:00.000Z	hoverbear	magpii	Stable. 11.11 is beta
2011-09-16T03:11:00.000Z	hoverbear	magpii	On a 233 mhz proc? You can get *single* touch on linux from puppy linux and such. iirc the majority of touchscreens don't support multi-touch

2011-09-16T03:15:00.000Z	hoverbear	magpii	Check out puppy linux, it should run on that hardware
2011-09-16T03:16:00.000Z	hoverbear	magpii	I think your question would be considered on-topic here. :)
