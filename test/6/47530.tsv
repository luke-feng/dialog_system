2008-11-16T21:39:00.000Z	Cluber		That really sucks. lol
2008-11-16T21:39:00.000Z	InfectedWithDrew		Yes, Cluber, it does, and if the Pidgin team would fix that, well, I'd probably send them money.  Keep in mind that Pidgin-to-Pidgin works better than Pidgin-to-Messenger.
2008-11-16T21:39:00.000Z	Cluber	InfectedWithDrew	Okay thanks.
