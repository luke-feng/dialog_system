2009-12-26T19:19:00.000Z	soreau	princeofgiri	You might need to enable line in or maybe there is a physical issue
2009-12-26T19:19:00.000Z	princeofgiri	soreau	I try to configured it corectly, because I can record my guitar sound
2009-12-26T19:20:00.000Z	soreau	princeofgiri	Might also be a pulseaudio issue, not sure
