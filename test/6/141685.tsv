2005-07-29T15:56:00.000Z	Razor-X	catolh	you can always install flash in the browser you're using?
2005-07-29T15:56:00.000Z	catolh	Razor-X	well.. it is installed.. :p
2005-07-29T15:57:00.000Z	Razor-X	catolh	well, have you _configured_ it?
2005-07-29T15:57:00.000Z	catolh	Razor-X	doesnt it do that by itself if i do apt-get install flashplayer-mozilla ?.. :p
2005-07-29T15:57:00.000Z	catolh	Razor-X	sometimes it works.. and sometimes it just crashes
