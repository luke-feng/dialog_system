2006-06-01T07:04:00.000Z	ggilbert	exhale	Xchat-gnome has a bit of a nicer ui, but it doesn't have every feature of xchat
2006-06-01T07:04:00.000Z	exhale	ggilbert	is xchat-gnome default in dapper?
2006-06-01T07:06:00.000Z	ggilbert	exhale	happily both are in the repository, so we can use what we each like :)
