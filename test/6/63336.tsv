2008-02-21T16:54:00.000Z	HackTalk		I need to know something about linux; what sounds nicer: xnode.org or xcoal.net?
2008-02-21T16:55:00.000Z	HackTalk		Anyone?
2008-02-21T16:57:00.000Z	HackTalk		Can no one of you experts anser my ubuntu-related question?
2008-02-21T16:58:00.000Z	flegged	HackTalk	"what sounds nicer" isn't really an "ubuntu-related" question
2008-02-21T16:59:00.000Z	flegged	HackTalk	usually has the opposite effect
2008-02-21T16:59:00.000Z	flegged	HackTalk	what's your real problem?
