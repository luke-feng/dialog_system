2006-11-10T07:05:00.000Z	RP3		Does anyone here know how to make a DVD RW drive work under Edgy?
2006-11-10T07:05:00.000Z	ailean	RP3	should work by default
2006-11-10T07:06:00.000Z	RP3	ailean	 nope
2006-11-10T07:08:00.000Z	RP3		I guess I can always delete Linux and go back to Windows since Windows will read CDs
2006-11-10T07:10:00.000Z	ailean	RP3	you're not giving enough information
2006-11-10T07:10:00.000Z	ailean	RP3	tell us what you're doing and someone might be able to help.
