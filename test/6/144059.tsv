2005-07-07T05:25:00.000Z	Will__		Oh! I have one. Anybody know a way to scroll workspaces using the mouse wheel under gnome? It works when I mouse-over the workspace switcher, but I'd like it to work when I am over the desktop/root window also
2005-07-07T05:25:00.000Z	Seveas	Will__	yes :) sudo -i is the Ubuntu way to get a root shell
2005-07-07T05:26:00.000Z	Will__	Seveas	*grin* I know. Old habits.
2005-07-07T14:42:00.000Z	Will__	Seveas	I'll write that one down
