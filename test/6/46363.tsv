2008-12-04T02:46:00.000Z	rlt	cdg52	The message you linked was ~albertomilone asking for a Stable Release Update to the nvidia drivers, and providing links to the changes he wants making to the package
2008-12-04T02:46:00.000Z	rlt	cdg52	The message I linked was someone saying that those changes had been accepted into intrepid-proposed and giving you instructions on how to get them.
