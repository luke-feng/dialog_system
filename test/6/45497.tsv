2009-02-15T11:37:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire		Its more general hardware stuff
2009-02-15T11:39:00.000Z	maslen	GodfatherofEire	there's a channel called #hardware
2009-02-15T11:39:00.000Z	maslen	GodfatherofEire	might be useful
2009-02-15T11:39:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	maslen	yeah, I was told that once, but I thought it might have been a joke, not an actual serious answer
2009-02-15T11:40:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	maslen	Then when you and Mood said that, I figured it wasnt a joke
