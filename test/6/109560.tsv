2006-10-23T07:04:00.000Z	rus1	nu	can you tell me how to start the sendmail service?
2006-10-23T07:04:00.000Z	nu		does mail(to, subject, etc, etc) give you an SMTP error?
2006-10-23T07:05:00.000Z	nu	rus1	i don't remember how. I'm sure google could find you an answer. if not, you could join a php channel on irc
