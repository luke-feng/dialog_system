2011-07-18T18:20:00.000Z	brahmana	BluesKaj	I am pretty sure I deleted the Ubuntu parition. Though I had that other problem that you stated quite a few years ago... :)
2011-07-18T18:30:00.000Z	BluesKaj	brahmana	if you can find an app called easyBCD then you should be able fix the mbr on W7/Vista using that .
2011-07-18T18:31:00.000Z	brahmana	BluesKaj	Just looked at easyBCD's website. Does it work when I am not able to boot into any OS at all?
2011-07-18T18:32:00.000Z	BluesKaj	brahmana	I thought it was on a live-cd
2011-07-18T18:33:00.000Z	brahmana	BluesKaj	Ok. Will read the guides. Thank you for the suggestion.
