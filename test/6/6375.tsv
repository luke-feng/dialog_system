2011-09-22T00:02:00.000Z	warmax26		i have a question
2011-09-22T00:02:00.000Z	warmax26		if i delete the ubuntu folder that contains ubuntu on my windows 7 computer will that get rid of ubuntu?
2011-09-22T00:03:00.000Z	warmax26		wait so if i just delete the folder it will be gone?
2011-09-22T00:03:00.000Z	pythonsnake	warmax26	the question is stupid - will you delete ubuntu if you delete ubuntu ?
2011-09-22T00:03:00.000Z	pythonsnake	warmax26	delete root = no more ubuntu
2011-09-22T00:05:00.000Z	pythonsnake	warmax26	hmm.
