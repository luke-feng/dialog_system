2009-06-30T03:51:00.000Z	gidna		When Does it create them?
2009-06-30T03:51:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	gidna	when you con't save for long enough, or you save. it can be turned off.
2009-06-30T03:57:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	gidna	Yes. at any time.
2009-06-30T03:57:00.000Z	Rabbitbunny	gidna	You'll probably want gedit to stop making them, check it's preferences.
