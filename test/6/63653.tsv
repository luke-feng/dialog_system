2008-07-25T03:53:00.000Z	orsi		anyone know how to get sonata 1.4.2 to display lyrics? (python-zsi already installed but that doesnt seem top help)
2008-07-25T03:54:00.000Z	orsi		or is there any version of sonata above 1.4.2 available somewhere?
2008-07-25T03:54:00.000Z	histo	orsi	google?
2008-07-25T03:55:00.000Z	orsi	histo	ok, i just thought this might be something everyone is experiencing since the version in the repo is broken...
2008-07-25T03:57:00.000Z	histo	orsi	maybe search the forums. But the people that make the app may have an update on their site.
2008-07-25T03:57:00.000Z	orsi	histo	ok, ill check. thank you
