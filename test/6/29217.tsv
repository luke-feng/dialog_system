2009-10-26T04:04:00.000Z	knoppies	krummlauf	are your speakers connected to your computer with a USB interface? or are they just normal speakers with a stereo jack?

2009-10-26T04:06:00.000Z	knoppies	krummlauf	it does, but you need drivers for your specific USB accessory, I would search fr drivers for your model of speakers
