2007-06-25T14:26:00.000Z	LeGeeko		Hey, sorry to bother you but my X server crashed, and refuses to un-crash
2007-06-25T14:26:00.000Z	LeGeeko		Can someone please tell me how to fix it? Thanks!
2007-06-25T14:27:00.000Z	LeGeeko		In terminal login, just installed a new graphics driver
2007-06-25T14:28:00.000Z	LeGeeko		It gives my the "screen not found" error
2007-06-25T14:29:00.000Z	LeGeeko		OK, but how do I use the old one again?
