2010-04-30T14:06:00.000Z	joaopinto	AngryKoala	/etc/init and /etc/rc*
2010-04-30T14:06:00.000Z	AngryKoala	joaopinto	and that has the order in which they boot?
2010-04-30T14:06:00.000Z	joaopinto	AngryKoala	the order is hard to identify, you need to check the scripts
2010-04-30T14:07:00.000Z	AngryKoala	joaopinto	alright, will do, thanks
