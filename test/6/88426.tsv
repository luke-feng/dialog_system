2008-04-15T05:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sarthor	 ive heard its possible to install that way. But uve never done so.
2009-01-25T16:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sarthor	 you would have to figure otu what ports limewire uses those and block those ports..  it can get tricky with some of those p2p apps
2009-01-25T16:52:00.000Z	sarthor	Dr_willis	if i found all or maximum ports of limeware, then i can drop them... but problem is this..how to find that ports....
2009-01-25T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sarthor	 google is our friend. :) Ive no idea what ports it uses. it very likely can change ports also.
