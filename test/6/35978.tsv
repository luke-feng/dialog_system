2011-03-19T22:03:00.000Z	edbian	BCMM	yeah he wasn't talking to you.  hahaa
2011-03-19T22:03:00.000Z	edbian	BCMM	In response to your question.  I am not aware of an installer that installs to another computer.  But if you get the installer running you can use it to install to any hdd connected to that machine.

2011-03-19T22:06:00.000Z	edbian	BCMM	mmmmm,  perhaps.  You can download the source, compile it, and then try to run it. It's just a program.  Will it work?  I don't know.  (seems like it probably won't be able to find the files it needs to copy)
2011-03-19T22:07:00.000Z	edbian	BCMM	Yeah it would be a tremendous amount of trouble.  I'm not aware of a pre-configured solution like you're looking for.
