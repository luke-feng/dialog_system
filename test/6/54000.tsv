2008-11-05T16:11:00.000Z	siccness	burkesbythebay	im confuse, just seems like a basic mbr issue
2008-11-05T16:15:00.000Z	burkesbythebay	siccness	 i think the hard disk is faulty as it clicks every now and then.  bit alot of the threads point to grub or mbr being the problem
2008-11-05T16:16:00.000Z	siccness	burkesbythebay	sure but that doesnt explain why usb doesnt work
2008-11-05T16:17:00.000Z	burkesbythebay	siccness	what's usb got to do with it im running a sata hard disk
