2011-06-18T02:36:00.000Z	beli	jon8	thats not what ifconfig is ment to do...you could script something and calculate the difference manually...but there are better tools for countung packages sent...
2011-06-18T02:36:00.000Z	jon8	beli	so is there or is there not a way to reset the packet counters in ifconfig
2011-06-18T02:37:00.000Z	beli	jon8	i guess not, you might trick it with overwriting some proc tree entries...but there are tools to do what you want
