2009-05-23T21:51:00.000Z	Baen		someone? That has got to be the easiest question asked tonight.
2009-05-23T21:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Baen	what was your question?
2009-05-23T21:52:00.000Z	Baen	IndyGunFreak	I was asking how to check which graphics driver I'm using
2009-05-23T21:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Baen	well, you can look in system/admin/hardware drivers.. if you're using a proprietary one, it could be there.
2009-05-23T21:53:00.000Z	Baen	IndyGunFreak	It's not. :) I just wanna check if I completely removed the driver.
