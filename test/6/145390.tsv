2009-04-08T18:35:00.000Z	jmap82		I'm trying to capture the output of HandBrakeCLI to use its title info in a script...
2009-04-08T18:36:00.000Z	jmap82		yeah, I can read it, but I can't seem to capture it
2009-04-08T18:36:00.000Z	jmap82		I've tried pipes and redirects and now tee...
2009-04-08T18:37:00.000Z	jmap82		the only thing that seems to capture it is 'script' but I can't use that in a script...
2009-04-08T18:38:00.000Z	jmap82		"./HandBrakeCLI -i /media/cdrom0/VIDEO_TS/ -t 0 | tee titles.txt" which then runs HandBrake as expected, but the file is blank
2009-04-08T18:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	jmap82	maybe HandBrake is using stderr instead of stdout ?
