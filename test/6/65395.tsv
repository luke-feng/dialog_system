2008-01-23T09:57:00.000Z	ghost		The guys over in the OSX board say that it is hardest to go from linux to mac
2008-01-23T09:58:00.000Z	TheEpitome	ghost	I agree, it's like linux but more restrictive
2008-01-23T09:59:00.000Z	ghost	TheEpitome	easyer to build a freeBSD box then learn mac?
2008-01-23T10:24:00.000Z	ghost	TheEpitome	the thing about games is weird: If it was a copy protection issue then they can just drop that now. Ultra easy to copy/crack games in windows environment.
2008-01-23T10:25:00.000Z	TheEpitome	ghost	its not about copy protection, its about all the windows dlls being called by windows apps.  whats what the wine project does.  the DotGNU project is good for VB/C#/.NET stuff
2008-01-23T10:26:00.000Z	ghost	TheEpitome	DotGNU for those weird apps like say my cell phone sync software
