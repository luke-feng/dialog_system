2007-12-15T02:51:00.000Z	YeTr2	wraund	builtin tells us nothing. who made the chipset?
2007-12-15T02:52:00.000Z	wraund	YeTr2	thats just the problem
2007-12-15T02:52:00.000Z	YeTr2	wraund	you don't know what model of PC it is?
2007-12-15T02:53:00.000Z	YeTr2	wraund	and that still tells us nothing. you'll have to wait. I would guess either nvidia or ati. most likely ATi.. it seems to be a favorite still with dell and hp for teh basic models.
2007-12-15T02:53:00.000Z	wraund	YeTr2	i think it may be nvidia, my dad does favour them
