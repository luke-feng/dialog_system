2011-12-27T10:09:00.000Z	rtaycher		Hi, my left click seems to break after using it for a while and I need to restart the XServer,(on a thinkpad T510) the amount of time it takes to stop working varies, pluggin in a usb mice and the usb mice can't left click either, any suggestions or pointers to threads with similar problems?

2011-12-27T10:16:00.000Z	rtaycher	aBound	what do you mean not interative? It still moves, right clicking still works(right clicking used to stop working a bit of time after left clicking but I haven't seen that recently)
