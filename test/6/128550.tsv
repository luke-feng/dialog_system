2005-12-19T07:35:00.000Z	JoeyDay|ubuntu		Is there a default root password? I don't recall setting one up during install.
2005-12-19T07:36:00.000Z	HymnToLife	JoeyDay|ubuntu	> you can set one
2005-12-19T07:36:00.000Z	JoeyDay|ubuntu	HymnToLife	How?
2005-12-19T07:36:00.000Z	HymnToLife		but you won't need it anyway
2005-12-19T07:36:00.000Z	HymnToLife	JoeyDay|ubuntu	> sudo chpasswd root
