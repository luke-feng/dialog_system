2007-05-02T12:26:00.000Z	JerryMcFarts		Hello, I am having a problem With Gnome, It will totally freeze, I can not alt+ctrl+backspace. The mouse will be frozen also. This is when I boot into it normally, and I don't really do anything at all. I started noticing freezes when I installed VMWARE workstation and Deluge torrent cleint. But now it freezes when those aren't even started. How can I view what is erroring out?
2007-05-02T12:27:00.000Z	ajax4	JerryMcFarts	do you use xgl, aixgl, beryl, or compiz?
2007-05-02T12:28:00.000Z	ajax4	JerryMcFarts	I've had many instability issues with xgl/beryl and vmware.
2007-05-02T12:30:00.000Z	JerryMcFarts	ajax4	so beryl not started automatically would that still effect my VMware installation? I assume VMware dameons start up since I can use the VMware player, but as of Beryl I have to activate it manually. This is on a clean install of fiesty fawn. I really didn't have any problem until I recently installed Deluge torrent and I attributed my freezing to that. What logs can I look at that will show me more input on whats going wrong?
2007-05-02T12:32:00.000Z	ajax4	JerryMcFarts	that I don't know. It could be something totally unrelated to vmware, I just mentioned that I had compatibility problems with vmware and the desktop effects, but that may not be why you are having lockups.
