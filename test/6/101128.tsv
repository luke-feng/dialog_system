2007-01-07T10:33:00.000Z	MSTK		I'm sorry for asking a lot of questions, but is there a Parallels-type application in Ubuntu where I can emulate an XP environment?
2007-01-07T10:34:00.000Z	ublender	MSTK	let me suggest researching wine, vmware, cedega, and crossover office
2007-01-07T10:34:00.000Z	MSTK	Aggort	Wine just runs windows apps in Ubuntu
2007-01-07T10:34:00.000Z	MSTK		is there any way I can have, say, a window running that's a Windows desktop?
2007-01-07T10:34:00.000Z	ublender		STK: vmware
2007-01-07T10:34:00.000Z	ublender	MSTK	vmware
