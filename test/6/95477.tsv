2007-01-21T08:50:00.000Z	uii1	gibbonsfire4	it's inside your computer next to the motherboard
2007-01-21T08:51:00.000Z	uii1	gibbonsfire4	:) is it mounted?

2007-01-21T09:04:00.000Z	uii1	gibbonsfire4	what happens when you try to mount? and yes - you can edit fstab...
2007-01-21T09:05:00.000Z	uii1	gibbonsfire4	/dev/hdb       /harddrive              ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0       1
