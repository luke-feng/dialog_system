2009-12-01T06:02:00.000Z	Bolvadur2	spydon	think not. just use static ips and keep a list with ips and paths to shared directories
2009-12-01T06:03:00.000Z	spydon	Bolvadur2	too bad, do you know if there is a standard share created somewhere when you install the nfsserver?
2009-12-01T06:04:00.000Z	Bolvadur2	spydon	by default no. as it would create security risk :)
2009-12-01T06:04:00.000Z	spydon	Bolvadur2	good :)
2009-12-01T06:05:00.000Z	Bolvadur2	spydon	you only need to change (install) exports and fstab, that's it
