2007-08-26T15:37:00.000Z	nbkr	balbir	Just download the installer from vmware.com, Install the kernel-sources, make and gcc if not already done and run the VMware Installer.

2007-08-26T15:39:00.000Z	nbkr	balbir	You can use qemu and virtualbox with ubuntu. Xen should also be possible and I think it is included in 7.10.
