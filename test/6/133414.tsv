2005-11-03T17:44:00.000Z	WebLOCH		I have tried to add a variable to my set of environment variables by editing /etc/profile because i wanted to set it system-wide, once i log in however the variable no longer exists, but if i hit "ctrl alt f1" and check from the terminal it does exist, I have tried rebooting... can anyone help?
