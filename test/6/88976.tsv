2010-05-06T21:23:00.000Z	wildman		hello there. I'm on ubuntu 9.1, I've moved all data from one hard disk to another, and now this disk won't boot (because of different UUIDs for the hard disks). How do I find the current UUID for a hard disk?
2010-05-06T21:24:00.000Z	llutz	wildman	"sudo blkid"
2010-05-06T21:24:00.000Z	wildman	llutz	thx
2010-05-06T21:25:00.000Z	wildman	llutz	so, just changing the uuid in grub's config will do? or will I have to reinstall grub too? (grub started to boot, but stopped stating it couldn't find a device with the uuid - which was expected cuz this disk is different)
2010-05-06T21:25:00.000Z	llutz	wildman	should do, check /etc/fstab too
2010-05-06T21:25:00.000Z	wildman	llutz	rite, thx
