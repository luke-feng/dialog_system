2007-10-19T05:58:00.000Z	PAStheLoD	flick	system -> settings -> desktop effects
2007-10-19T05:58:00.000Z	flick	PAStheLoD	there seems to be no settings in System
2007-10-19T05:59:00.000Z	PAStheLoD	flick	options or something apart from Administration ?
2007-10-19T05:59:00.000Z	flick	PAStheLoD	System -> Preferences -> Appearance is not comprehensive...
2007-10-19T06:01:00.000Z	PAStheLoD	flick	desktop effects , not appearance .. If you don't have desktop effects then use synaptic to get compiz packages
