2005-08-03T05:49:00.000Z	procrastinator	philstar	How could you think otherwise? ;)
2005-08-03T05:49:00.000Z	philstar	procrastinator	cause someone else said so...
2005-08-03T05:50:00.000Z	philstar	procrastinator	plus, there's a big thing about trademarks on the ubuntu website
2005-08-03T05:51:00.000Z	philstar		but thanks
2005-08-03T05:52:00.000Z	procrastinator	philstar	Oh. I'm quite sure it's free (as in freedom), and I would presume it's GPL, too. And trademarks would have nothing to do with that.
