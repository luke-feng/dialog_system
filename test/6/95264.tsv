2007-02-05T10:05:00.000Z	shatrat	jessid	also, hot hard drives are prone to failure, and a drive that suddenly runs hotter than it used to is a sign that a drive might be about to fail

2007-02-05T10:07:00.000Z	jessid	shatrat	you r right, but i imagine there is a configuration file to make the hd to "disable" or turn off (dont know exactly the term)
2007-02-05T10:08:00.000Z	shatrat	jessid	I imagine there is as well, but if your hard drives are getting hot that is only a bandaid.  You need to fix the problem by cooling them.  Ball bearing 80mm fans are only a few dollars, and can save your hard drives.
