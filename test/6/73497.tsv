2007-12-02T20:58:00.000Z	KonjikiNoyami		Hi, I've just upgraded to Ubuntu 7.10, I'm trying to install the restricted formats by using the command "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras", now some messages about Java T&C appear in the terminal window for a while and have not disappeared. Does it freeze or is it still updating and I just need to be patient? Thanks
