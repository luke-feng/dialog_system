2005-11-18T09:05:00.000Z	snorks	Trackilizer	apt-get install vlc-alsa-plugin (or vlc-plugin-alsa)
2005-11-18T09:06:00.000Z	snorks	Trackilizer	apt-cache search vlc | grep alsa
2005-11-18T09:07:00.000Z	Trackilizer	snorks	thanks alot, it worked.
2005-11-18T09:08:00.000Z	snorks	Trackilizer	Well, I changed output plugin from esd to ALSA in XMMS not long ago. It was easy. System -> Preferences -> Sound, then uncheck "enable sound server at startup", and then enter XMMS and set output module to alsa
2005-11-18T09:10:00.000Z	Trackilizer	snorks	once again thanks alot.
