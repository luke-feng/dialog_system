2009-07-12T09:10:00.000Z	soreau	mividaendigital	Which resolution are you trying to achieve?
2009-07-12T09:11:00.000Z	soreau	mividaendigital	Have you tried looking in Sys>Prefs>Display yet?
2009-07-12T09:15:00.000Z	mividaendigital	soreau	check and says a already have that resolution. i think is the driver
