2012-01-18T21:51:00.000Z	Wargasm		I'm running ubuntu 11.10 with a lxde DE.  The battery monitor in lxde is stuck at 100% but the gnome power manager is working accurately.  Anyone know how I can fix the lxde battery monitor so it can work properly?
2012-01-18T21:53:00.000Z	Wargasm		I'm running a separate battery monitor so I can monitor my battery level lol
