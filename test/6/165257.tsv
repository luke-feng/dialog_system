2005-12-11T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	owner989	 gnome has some settings as to what to auto-mount  for the user.
2005-12-11T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	owner989	 but im not sure if you can set it for a SINGLE thing..its a all or nothing  I think
2005-12-11T11:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	owner989	 oh -  you could just edit the fstab and try to mount it manually and see what the deal is.
2005-12-11T11:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	owner989	 it may be mad theres no card in the slot.
