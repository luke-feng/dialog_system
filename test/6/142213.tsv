2009-12-29T10:06:00.000Z	slinkeey		Hello -- I have something that is going to sound stupid..  I have two of the same notebook computers.  One runs XP and the other Ubuntu 9.10.. For some reason the one running ubuntu 9.10 gets a low wireless signal.   I thought maybe it was hardware so I swapped hard drives between the two (Same exact hardware) and no atter what, the one running XP gets a more reliable wireless signal.

2009-12-29T10:09:00.000Z	slinkeey		check if my notebook turned up?
2009-12-29T10:09:00.000Z	slinkeey		like if the signal turned up?
