2012-06-13T12:47:00.000Z	fidel	Us3r_Unfriendly	this might depend on what hardware you choose in the first place
2012-06-13T12:49:00.000Z	fidel	Us3r_Unfriendly	what means difficult? industry just doesnt care so far to run something else on them
2012-06-13T12:51:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	fidel	i mean as in android is something for the new generation to play with.  for me this means nothing.  I want my linux distro I choose to run on a common tablet of my choosing.
2012-06-13T12:52:00.000Z	Us3r_Unfriendly	fidel	without vnc'ing on top of android?
2012-06-13T12:54:00.000Z	fidel	Us3r_Unfriendly	i think a pretty common model - running linux&kde might be the vivaldi-tablet
