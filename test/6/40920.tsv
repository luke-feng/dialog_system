2010-04-13T02:21:00.000Z	InvisibleMan		I'm going to be running a script.  I want to ensure that the script doesn't have any access to my files or the shared files on the local network.  How would I do this?

2010-04-13T02:23:00.000Z	InvisibleMan	acicula	Ah, so it isn't just a quick fix...  All right, thanks.
2010-04-13T02:23:00.000Z	acicula	InvisibleMan	well creating an apparmor provile wich doesnt allow anything is pretty easy
2010-04-13T02:24:00.000Z	InvisibleMan	acicula	Installing and setting up the program is the problem.  I don't use Linux usually.  The only reason I have it installed is because I don't have another copy of XP :S
