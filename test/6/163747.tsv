2005-10-31T17:28:00.000Z	topyli	racookier	sudo only works for users set up properly in the /etc/sudoers file
2005-10-31T17:29:00.000Z	topyli	racookier	you can give some users the powers to execute system upgrades and nothing else, and other users the power to do anything. others will have no super powers
2005-10-31T17:30:00.000Z	topyli	racookier	the first user is given all sudo rights
2005-10-31T17:31:00.000Z	topyli	racookier	if you're the first user made during installation, you have ultimate power
2005-10-31T17:32:00.000Z	topyli	racookier	yes. sudo any-command will work
