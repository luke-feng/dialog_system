2007-02-08T09:36:00.000Z	xcidental		does ubuntu cache the settings of xorg.conf?  asking because i added a resolution to the listing, rebooted and cannot select the new resolution
2007-02-08T09:38:00.000Z	xcidental		xorg says i have the nv driver installed
2007-02-08T09:39:00.000Z	hbaigu	xcidental	see what says in the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log about that resolution
2007-02-08T09:41:00.000Z	xcidental		hysnc out of range...so im guessing update driver, reboot x and all should be solved?
2007-02-08T09:42:00.000Z	hbaigu	xcidental	that mean that the mode is not in the range valid for that monitor
2007-02-08T09:44:00.000Z	xcidental	hbaigu	its my 1080p lcd monitor so it should handle the resolution, maybe the drivers i have currently cant support it
