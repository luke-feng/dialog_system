2008-12-17T19:08:00.000Z	Leon_		Does anybody know a good off-topic random-advice channel on freenode?
2008-12-17T19:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Leon_	#ubuntu is not an irc directory - look on the freenode channel list
2008-12-17T19:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Leon_	not ehre
2008-12-17T19:09:00.000Z	Leon_	ikonia	That's why I'm asking where. You know any busy channels anywhere?
2008-12-17T19:10:00.000Z	Leon_	ikonia	There are about 5000 channels there, not a lot of them seem to be active and off-topic, so I thought I would just ask here because people here might nÂ´know the freenode network better than I do
2008-12-17T19:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Leon_	read the cahnnel list and find one and try it
