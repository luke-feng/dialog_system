2008-01-23T10:16:00.000Z	SR71-Blackbird		can someone remind me of a tool to log system inputs?
2008-01-23T10:17:00.000Z	TheEpitome	SR71-Blackbird	install-watch, install-log
2008-01-23T10:18:00.000Z	SR71-Blackbird	TheEpitome	no.. a graphical tool.. that takes mouse.. keyboard actions...
2008-01-23T10:18:00.000Z	TheEpitome		Thugcation: yes, boot to the livecd and check it out first
2008-01-23T10:18:00.000Z	TheEpitome	SR71-Blackbird	sounds like a keylogger, trying to make a trojan?
2008-01-23T10:19:00.000Z	SR71-Blackbird	TheEpitome	no.. i'm just trying to see whatever my buttons map to... to use those values
