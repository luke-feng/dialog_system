2010-05-26T20:30:00.000Z	lolmac		hello, how do i write in the hardrive locations adress bar in ubuntu? in early versions there was a pencil icon that allowed me to write, but how do i do it in version 10.04?
2010-05-26T20:32:00.000Z	lolmac		but is possible to write without the pencil, with some shortcurt of some sort?
2010-05-26T20:33:00.000Z	lolmac		i don't really need the pencil, just any way to write/copy/cut the information on the hardrive adress bar on file browser

2010-05-26T20:41:00.000Z	Night_Elf	lolmac	well, my debian was installed around one year ago. I do the updates all right, but I'm not very keen on upgrades. So I have to check.
