2010-10-19T07:30:00.000Z	Dulak	pepone	you don't want to set it for every user, it could cause issues
2010-10-19T07:33:00.000Z	pepone	Dulak	my php extesion should also work in command line scripts so i need it to be set for all users that execute php scripts
2010-10-19T07:35:00.000Z	Dulak	pepone	that's not exactly portable, but whatever works I suppose
