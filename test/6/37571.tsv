2009-06-02T05:19:00.000Z	nasa1		apparently you can downgrade xorg using synaptic but I dont see how
2009-06-02T05:20:00.000Z	nasa1		wait
2009-06-02T05:21:00.000Z	nasa1		is there a way I can upgrade my 8.04 to 9.04 without upgrading the xorg?

2009-06-02T05:21:00.000Z	fccf	nasa1	- that may or may not work ... but you can "lock version" in synaptic
2009-06-02T05:22:00.000Z	fccf	nasa1	in synaptic you can select the package you want to lock ... then in the menus package>lock version
