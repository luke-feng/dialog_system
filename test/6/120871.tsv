2006-04-24T12:06:00.000Z	AleXC_		Hey, I can see my Mac in Network Servers - but when I double click on it, it just goes to an empty directory
2006-04-24T12:06:00.000Z	AleXC_		Why is this?
2006-04-24T12:07:00.000Z	jmoncayo	AleXC_	in what network server do you find it?
2006-04-24T12:08:00.000Z	AleXC_	jmoncayo	in Network -> Windows Network -> workgroup -> SCOTTS-MAC
2006-04-24T12:09:00.000Z	jmoncayo	AleXC_	thats maybe sometime you connected to that machine or from that machine
2006-04-24T12:09:00.000Z	AleXC_	jmoncayo	nope, Mac has never connected to this pc
