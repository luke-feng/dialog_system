2007-12-19T12:23:00.000Z	Jeah		Does anyone know why the eject button on my DVD ROM doesn't work in Ubuntu with a disc in when the one on my CD burner does?
2007-12-19T12:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Jeah	sounds like a hardware issue
2007-12-19T12:24:00.000Z	Jeah	nickrud	It works in BIOS, Windows, and Ubuntu (without a disc in), so I'm a little hesitant to blame the hardware.  I also posted in the forums, and several other people said they had the same problem with DVD ROM's.
2007-12-19T12:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Jeah	do they all talk about the same brand and or model?
2007-12-19T12:26:00.000Z	Jeah	nickrud	That didn't come up.  Maybe I should post and see if I can get responses to that.
