2008-05-29T12:18:00.000Z	darren_		Hey guys, i know that i'm probably sol here, but I have a bunch of email saved into a pst file, any ideas on how to import them into evolution?
2008-05-29T12:20:00.000Z	Flannel	darren_	I know thunderbird can do it.  And I believe there are some converters out there too, most are for windows.  Evolution may be able to import it as well, I haven't tried in ages.

2008-09-14T04:43:00.000Z	darren_	Flannel	so if i do update mananger does that sort it out for me
2008-09-14T04:43:00.000Z	Flannel	darren_	Yep, update manager takes care of it
