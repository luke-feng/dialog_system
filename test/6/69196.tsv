2007-12-31T00:37:00.000Z	Creationist	glontu	This isn't the "I Didn't RTFM" channel... toodles :P
2007-12-31T00:41:00.000Z	Creationist	glontu	Yeah, my ex's wifi worked perfectly from the LiveCD but took hours of Google and tweaking to get it to work after installing.... weird, huh?
2007-12-31T00:41:00.000Z	glontu	Creationist	well that's not cool
2007-12-31T00:41:00.000Z	Creationist	glontu	That's what I thought.  It should be the other way around if anything.
