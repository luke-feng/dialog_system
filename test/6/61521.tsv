2008-04-08T17:59:00.000Z	DistroJockey	izinucs	depends on what you want :)
2008-04-08T18:00:00.000Z	izinucs	DistroJockey	true.. but that's kinda the "standard" convention used.. of course you can mount what ever ,, where ever
2008-04-08T18:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	izinucs	media shows on the Desktop (if you don't change the defaults) I guess
2008-04-08T18:02:00.000Z	izinucs	DistroJockey	it does.. but there's a way to turn that off so you don't have to look at a lot of drives/partitions if you don't want.
2008-04-08T18:02:00.000Z	DistroJockey	izinucs	yup
