2009-02-21T07:08:00.000Z	f_newton		I dont know from away nicks... some of the nicks people use are downright stupid but its not for me to ridicule them...
2009-02-21T07:09:00.000Z	f_newton		how? do they auto repeat away msgs?  that should not happen unless set
2009-02-21T07:09:00.000Z	f_newton		yeah
2009-02-21T07:09:00.000Z	tritium	f_newton	hmw: continuing the offtopic discussion of away nicks also floods the channel
2009-02-23T08:17:00.000Z	tritium	f_newton	other way around
