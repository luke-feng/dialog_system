2006-11-27T06:00:00.000Z	Discerer		Doesn't that mess up the *nix/win filesystems?
2006-11-27T06:00:00.000Z	Discerer		thanks bruenig

2006-11-27T06:02:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Discerer	use a win util to shrink it down and make room for Ubuntu, reboot , be sure Win is cool, then do the install and put Ubuntu in the partition you made
2006-11-27T06:03:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	Discerer	the reason, occasionally the parted utility that is used to shrink the partitions will foul up the boot record of the windows install, it's easier to get that all sorted out first then have to repair it after IMO
