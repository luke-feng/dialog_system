2009-03-31T04:06:00.000Z	DasEi	sonink	again, the xserver is not dependant from networking
2009-03-31T04:11:00.000Z	sonink	DasEi	any idea if or how the KVM connection could be causing the problem?  I think a direct connection to the monitor has solved the problem in the past.  Does X have error logs I could check for hints?

2009-03-31T04:14:00.000Z	sonink	DasEi	okay.  I'll check that out.  Thanks
