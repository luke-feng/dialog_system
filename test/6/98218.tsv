2007-04-07T07:57:00.000Z	tarvid	IndyGunFreak	how about external tv tuners for laptops
2007-04-07T07:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tarvid	no clue
2007-07-27T07:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tarvid	exaile, but i don't think its near as good as amarok.
2007-07-27T07:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tarvid	why not just use amarok?
2007-12-31T05:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	tarvid	i would say for a 1.00, there's a VERY good chance that card doesn't work.
