2008-01-16T09:35:00.000Z	Smegzor		I am customising my desktop and want to remove the bottom panel without deleting it forever.  Whats the best way?  I have added window list to my top panel and I'm using AWN where my bottom panel sits.

2008-01-16T09:37:00.000Z	Smegzor	soldats	I don't see a no panel option (in the panel itself)  I rclicked it.

2008-01-16T09:38:00.000Z	soldats	Smegzor	havent done it in a while but just delete it, the panel properties will bring it back in the future
