2009-11-04T08:21:00.000Z	will1		I just installed 9.10, installed nvidia drivers, and set up dual monitors. And now I have no taskbars. :(
2009-11-04T08:21:00.000Z	will1		any ideas?
2009-11-04T08:22:00.000Z	will1		no list of tasks, no launching of programs... only one of the monitors can have windows dragged onto it, the other can take the cursor but nothing else.
