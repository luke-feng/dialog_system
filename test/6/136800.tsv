2005-12-19T13:45:00.000Z	pipeline	psusi	Well, you can log in, but you can't do much with a /bin/false shell, if you read me.
2005-12-19T13:45:00.000Z	psusi	pipeline	by default... but as with su, you can tell sshd ot use a real shell instead of false, can't you?
2005-12-19T13:46:00.000Z	psusi	pipeline	ahhh... I see
2005-12-19T13:51:00.000Z	pipeline	psusi	I thought rescue mode booted the system single-user?
2005-12-19T13:52:00.000Z	psusi	pipeline	yea... which prompts to you log in as root... which by default requires no password
