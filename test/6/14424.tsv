2010-12-21T03:18:00.000Z	yaaar		is there a quick way to get openssh server running on the 10.04 livecd? i figured i'd just apt-get it, but that fails telling me to run apt-get update, and that fails too
2010-12-21T03:19:00.000Z	mongy	yaaar	apt-get install ssh
2010-12-21T03:24:00.000Z	yaaar	mongy	well, i'm looking for the server, so that would be 'apt-get install openssh-server' ...but as i said, i tried that
2010-12-21T03:24:00.000Z	mongy	yaaar	its a metapackage for client and server.  its the only thing that works when running from live
2010-12-21T03:25:00.000Z	mongy	yaaar	odd..  works for me.
2010-12-21T03:26:00.000Z	yaaar	mongy	oh, ok. i'll try that meta package then
