2011-10-13T05:54:00.000Z	kydan	kogie	currently set to 128mb
2011-10-13T05:54:00.000Z	kogie	kydan	sudo chmod -R /dir
2011-10-13T05:59:00.000Z	kogie	kydan	may i ask if you already check if /upload exist?
2011-10-13T06:01:00.000Z	kydan	kogie	I doesnt atm, but it should be able to make, it. I have also tried making it and then trying it, the error I posted first is what you get when it does exist. the error when it doesnt says it cant make it. I think I may have found it though, I am running this as a vhost and the phpinfo that I just made for the site shows that max upload for that vhost is 2mb
2011-10-13T06:01:00.000Z	kydan	kogie	in the master php.ini its like 128, and I know that this is common solution to the issue, I just thought I had ruled it out.
