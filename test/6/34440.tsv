2009-08-28T01:57:00.000Z	Evelina		Why isn't it possible to connect to Internet after I changed the MAC using macchanger? I could connect to the wireless connection before?

2009-08-28T02:00:00.000Z	Evelina	codazoda	I don't have a router at all. I'm trying to connect to a wireless Internet connection using WEP. It works using the original MAC but not since I changed the MAC using macchanger.
2009-08-28T02:02:00.000Z	codazoda	Evelina	Sounds like you are connecting to a wireless router.  My router only allows certain MAC addresses to connect.  You might also try restarting your network?
2009-08-28T02:02:00.000Z	codazoda	Evelina	The wireless hot spot will keep track of you by your MAC.  Changing your MAC, therefore, may require you to re-connect.
