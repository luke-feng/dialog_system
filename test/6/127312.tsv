2010-03-03T05:21:00.000Z	vegarn		I attempted a "do-release-upgrade" on a Jaunty system to upgrade to Karmic
2010-03-03T05:22:00.000Z	vegarn		somewhere along the line, the ssh connection i used failed
2010-03-03T05:22:00.000Z	vegarn		I managed to ssh back in again, is there someway I can resume where it left off?
2010-03-03T05:23:00.000Z	vegarn		what do you mean automatically?
2010-03-03T05:25:00.000Z	vegarn		Militant: it tells me there is no new release, attempting apt-get update tells me there's a lock
