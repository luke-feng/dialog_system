2008-04-29T15:42:00.000Z	pisse		Hi! I just installed Warcraft III with wine.. the installation worked fine but when I get to the menu in the game it's all very very dark, almost black. But I can use the menu through my keyboard pushing 'L' for example. Anyone who's got any ideas?

2008-04-29T15:44:00.000Z	pisse	Fritzel	too bad.. do you have nvidia or radeon card?
2008-04-29T15:44:00.000Z	Fritzel	pisse	I'm nvidia for life
