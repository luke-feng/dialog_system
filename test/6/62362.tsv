2011-05-03T07:55:00.000Z	IdleOne	izinucs	there are plugins for skype in the repos but not skype itself
2011-05-03T07:56:00.000Z	IdleOne	izinucs	rather plugins for pidgin to work with skype...
2011-05-03T07:57:00.000Z	izinucs	IdleOne	hummm.. the command is the one I tried a few minutes ago and now it works.. sudo apt-get install skype.. seems to be working.. with that installed you mean I can also install the plugins for pidgeon etc right?
