2010-07-25T19:06:00.000Z	marienz	moritz__	I run vanilla ubuntu on an ancient laptop with 1280MB of ram, works sufficiently well for my needs
2010-07-25T19:06:00.000Z	marienz	moritz__	does boot and resume a bit slowly, but once it's up it works for me.
2010-07-25T19:07:00.000Z	marienz		but I guess I'm pretty patient :)
2010-07-25T19:07:00.000Z	moritz__	marienz	i'd have to have 4+ apps at the same time for work, which is itself a problem with 1gb of ram with these apps :(
2010-07-25T19:08:00.000Z	marienz	moritz__	ahh, I see.
2010-07-25T19:08:00.000Z	marienz	moritz__	yeah, I usually just run a browser, an editor, and one or more terms.
