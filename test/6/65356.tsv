2008-03-12T01:32:00.000Z	Gary_inNYC	Sl4y3r	i have issues with firefox as well... especially with pages such as break.com
2008-03-12T01:48:00.000Z	Gary_inNYC	Sl4y3r	did you install java from the "ubuntu-restricted-extras" metapackage?
2008-03-12T01:52:00.000Z	Gary_inNYC	Sl4y3r	for me I got java and various plugins and codecs running from the restricted extras metapackage, although performance in certain pages like break.com is spotty
