2011-05-08T10:04:00.000Z	Al_nz1		i think its showing in fdisk as /dev/sde4
2011-05-08T10:05:00.000Z	edbian	Al_nz1	If that's really it then sudo mount /dev/sde4 /mnt/   it will be placed in the /mnt folder
2011-05-08T10:05:00.000Z	edbian	Al_nz1	/mnt is there for mounting stuff in
2011-05-08T10:07:00.000Z	Al_nz1	edbian	I think i need to use mdadm
2011-05-08T10:07:00.000Z	edbian	Al_nz1	possibly
