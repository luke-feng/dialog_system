2009-05-18T12:11:00.000Z	ozzmosis	akidd116	using FreeBSD for years, I meant to say
2009-05-18T12:12:00.000Z	akidd116	ozzmosis	i think the best thing to happen to me when i installed this was for me to have a huge issue with my wireless stuff. it forced me to instantly learn a lot of basic commands and get familiar with it right away haha
2009-05-18T12:14:00.000Z	ozzmosis	akidd116	ah right.  I had some issues with a nvidia geforce 6600 (about four years old) .. none of the drivers in ubuntu 9.04 seem to support it.. my screen ran at 800x600 (vesa) until I installed nvidia's proprietary drivers
2009-05-18T12:15:00.000Z	akidd116	ozzmosis	it turns out i was just dumb and didnt know how to physically turn on the wireless for this computer
2009-05-18T12:16:00.000Z	ozzmosis	akidd116	heh ok.  I think my Brother laser printer might be like that.  have to wake it up using the button on the front.  Ubuntu can't take it off standby for me, like Windows does.  I think.
