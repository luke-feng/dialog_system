2008-06-19T03:50:00.000Z	zanberdo	afallenhope	not to be a smartass, but have you tried? :)
2008-06-19T03:51:00.000Z	afallenhope	zanberdo	yes... and I was unable to. hence the reason why I came here for help. smartass.
2008-06-19T03:52:00.000Z	zanberdo	afallenhope	well, your question didn't suggest that you'd tried and had a problem, nor did it describe with any detail what the problem was, so I just wanted to be sure you'd actually tried.
2008-06-19T03:52:00.000Z	afallenhope	zanberdo	clearly if 'm asking ... it's because I've tried.
2008-06-19T03:53:00.000Z	zanberdo	afallenhope	you haven't been in this channel long if you are going to make that assumption.
