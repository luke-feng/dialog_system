2012-07-15T21:05:00.000Z	escott	subdmg	confused by the fact that "lock" and "without a password" appear in the same sentence
2012-07-15T21:07:00.000Z	subdmg	escott	sorry about that, what I meant ppl have to have a password to access the shared folder
2012-07-15T21:08:00.000Z	escott	subdmg	those should allow you to establish passwords on shares
2012-07-15T21:08:00.000Z	subdmg	escott	ok thanks, i'll take a look at that.
2012-07-15T21:14:00.000Z	subdmg	escott	one question, if I'm sharing a folder with many folders in it, can I lock just one folder with in the shared folder?
