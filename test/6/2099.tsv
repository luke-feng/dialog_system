2012-05-18T16:29:00.000Z	jsjgruber-x-p	ms-daisy	you would wind up with copies of the contents of the files, but not a copy of the image of the hard disk. You may be

2012-05-18T16:33:00.000Z	ms-daisy	jsjgruber-x-p	thanks. Yes, I'm trying to rsync the home folder to the mounted second drive.  I'm getting errors though, "broken pipe".
2012-05-18T16:38:00.000Z	jsjgruber-x-p	ms-daisy	make sure you can read a file from the home directory and write a small file to where you are sending the files. Sounds like there is a problem with how you are specifying either the source or the destination.
2012-05-18T16:41:00.000Z	ms-daisy	jsjgruber-x-p	yes I agree.  I have rsynced to the server, but I want to rsync directly to the secondary hard drive. the command I used is this: rsync -azv -e  /home/msdaisy msdaisy@192.168.1.22:/media/HDD
