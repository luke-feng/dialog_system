2006-12-08T06:53:00.000Z	ryanakca		I have a backtrace if wanted
2006-12-08T06:55:00.000Z	nothlit	ryanakca	try restarting first, other wise... reinstall the apt utilities/backends like dselect from a livecd?
2006-12-08T08:00:00.000Z	ryanakca	nothlit	that stuff for apt that you suggested didn't work... I'm installing the ddebs for apt and apt-utils now..
