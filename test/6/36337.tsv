2010-09-14T11:32:00.000Z	hariom	rob_p	ok
2010-09-14T11:33:00.000Z	rob_p	hariom	I have a jeos vm and it works fine but I had to install quite a few things to make it do what I wanted.  A more typical install would have already included most of the things I ended up having to install.

2010-09-14T11:35:00.000Z	rob_p	hariom	Yes, it's well suited for running under vmware.
