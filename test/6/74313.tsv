2008-01-03T06:21:00.000Z	Strangework		I cannot type into the address bar in Nautilus, what's going on? I edited my SCIM input settings last night. Could that have anything to do with this?
2008-01-03T06:22:00.000Z	khermans	Strangework	change settings back and find out
2008-01-03T06:23:00.000Z	Strangework	khermans	I am not entirely sure what to change back, my memory is very lousy.
2008-01-03T06:23:00.000Z	khermans	Strangework	then you are out of luck :-)
2008-01-03T06:23:00.000Z	khermans	Strangework	or make a new user if your settings were user-specific
2008-01-03T06:23:00.000Z	Strangework	khermans	hm, I will try taht.
