2005-05-07T06:26:00.000Z	dcraven	hussam	you mean packages that have been marked for install, but you have since changed your mind?
2005-05-07T06:27:00.000Z	hussam	dcraven	no, in synaptic, click File > history
2005-05-07T06:28:00.000Z	dcraven	hussam	ahh yes. I've never noticed that before.
2005-05-07T06:29:00.000Z	hussam	dcraven	i found it, it's in preferences.
2005-05-07T06:31:00.000Z	dcraven	hussam	cool.
