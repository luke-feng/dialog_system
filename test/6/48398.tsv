2008-11-11T04:13:00.000Z	Deadmode	lakitu	i would just google search
2008-11-11T04:13:00.000Z	lakitu	Deadmode	i was hoping someone with experience could recommend the best program
2008-11-11T04:14:00.000Z	Deadmode	lakitu	mmm i seee i don't blame you there.  I have no experience with backing up partitions sorry.
