2011-10-12T19:05:00.000Z	tzhuang		is there anything i can do to get ready for the upcoming 11.10 release?
2011-10-12T19:06:00.000Z	tzhuang		first time going thru a distribution upgrade
2011-10-12T19:07:00.000Z	tzhuang		would it be better to reinstall the OS
2011-10-12T19:07:00.000Z	tzhuang		or just upgrade from natty
2011-10-12T19:07:00.000Z	auronandace	tzhuang	it would be better to reinstall afresh (especially since 11.10 gets rid of gnome2 for gnome3)
