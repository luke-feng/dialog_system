2006-06-02T05:59:00.000Z	ravel		how do I get IT8212 RAID controller support work with new Ubuntu? can I install Dapper on a RAID1 device?

2006-06-02T06:05:00.000Z	void^	ravel	hm, i'd suggest using software raid. the it821x module has a noraid option, could try playing around with that. otherwise i can only suggest a google search =)
2006-06-02T06:09:00.000Z	void^	ravel	that's true if you have a decent "real" raid controller. i just doubt this it8212 i got for 10 bucks does a better job than linux software raid =)
