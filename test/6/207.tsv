2012-11-29T06:34:00.000Z	RJ45-Q		I've been waiting about 20minutes for help, repeated my question about 3 times!, if I get nothing, you get nothing!
2012-11-29T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	RJ45-Q	please stay on-topic
2012-11-29T06:35:00.000Z	RJ45-Q	jrib	I am.
2012-11-29T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	RJ45-Q	"I've been waiting ..." was not appropriate
2012-11-29T06:35:00.000Z	RJ45-Q	jrib	how so?
2012-11-29T06:36:00.000Z	jrib	RJ45-Q	it's rude and more importantly has nothing to do with an actual support question.  Let's move on please...
