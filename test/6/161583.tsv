2005-05-20T15:19:00.000Z	Deft	eruin	or just script to check every 5 seconds is the opposite end of the scale
2005-07-10T14:54:00.000Z	eruin	Deft	colony2 is out, and xorg is back to normal, so this is probably as good a time as any
2005-07-10T14:55:00.000Z	eruin	Deft	though the 2.6.12 kernel is a mountain of trouble to me
