2006-08-25T13:18:00.000Z	phiber_optic	richiefrich	I know... but its weird even if im putting in the bios not to load the onboard
2006-08-25T13:23:00.000Z	phiber_optic	richiefrich	I can use the onboard... when i set it up but it only gives me a 2 channel sound and I have 5.1 speaker... if I could be able to configure the onboard i wouldnt care about the sound blaster.
