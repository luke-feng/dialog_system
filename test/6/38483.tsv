2009-08-19T15:53:00.000Z	indus	homebrewcider	hmm possible causes, faulty usb port, faulty cable, a bug in the driver itself, printer power button etc

2009-08-19T15:54:00.000Z	indus	homebrewcider	what printer
2009-08-19T15:54:00.000Z	indus	homebrewcider	so canon supplies the drivers for this? or ubuntu automatically does?
2009-08-19T16:09:00.000Z	indus	homebrewcider	seems like a driver issue frankly, write to cannon maybe
