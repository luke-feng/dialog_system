2011-05-01T21:15:00.000Z	IdleOne		good phonex01 thanks, did you have a support question?
2011-05-01T21:16:00.000Z	cheater2	IdleOne	any ideas? :x
2011-05-01T21:17:00.000Z	IdleOne	cheater2	haha no idea but I suggest you keep track of where it is. Seriously. try logging out and back in. that should reset things.
2011-05-01T21:20:00.000Z	cheater2	IdleOne	my problem is i can't log out, because i'm running ddrescue
2011-05-01T21:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	cheater2	you got me, sorry I can't help.
2011-05-01T21:21:00.000Z	cheater2	IdleOne	bit desperate :(
