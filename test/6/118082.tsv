2008-03-04T08:14:00.000Z	sarixe	Frogzoo	: it doesn't show up
2008-03-04T08:16:00.000Z	sarixe	Frogzoo	: it shows up as a camera, but not as a folder
2008-03-04T08:16:00.000Z	Frogzoo	sarixe	cool, now file -> import
2008-03-04T08:17:00.000Z	sarixe	Frogzoo	: that's not my goal.  i need to ultimately be able to format the card in the camera.  it doesn't seem to be mounted, or bound to any /dev device
