2008-07-04T21:18:00.000Z	ne2k__	netix	ask in the channel. if someone can help you, they will. if they can't, they won't. don't message people.
2008-07-04T21:19:00.000Z	ne2k__	netix	how long ago did you last ask your question?
2008-07-04T21:20:00.000Z	ne2k__	netix	leave it another twenty-five, then you can probably legitimately ask again.
2008-07-04T21:20:00.000Z	ne2k__	netix	what do you mean you want to get access to the java cache?
2008-07-04T21:39:00.000Z	ne2k__	netix	oh. my. gosh.
