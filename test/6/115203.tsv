2006-06-06T15:48:00.000Z	cvp	bullrage	Is it open source?
2006-06-06T15:50:00.000Z	bullrage	cvp	I meant Listen Music Player. I presume so, it runs on ubuntu.
2006-06-06T15:50:00.000Z	cvp	bullrage	Is it better than xmms and gxine?
2006-06-06T15:52:00.000Z	bullrage	cvp	The interface is a bit like Amarok. I've taken a screenshot for you, http://www.bullrage.com/listen.png
