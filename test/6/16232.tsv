2011-08-26T17:39:00.000Z	scarleo		The side menu in Unity (Dash?) is being reset everytime I switch user. All my personally added programs get removed and it reverts to default. Can it be fixed somehow?
2011-08-26T17:39:00.000Z	spacebug-	scarleo	that is a personalized "menu" so it is how it should work
2011-08-26T17:39:00.000Z	scarleo		Launcher might be the correct name
2011-08-26T17:40:00.000Z	scarleo	spacebug-	I think you get me wrong. If another user is using his account, MY launcher gets reset to default.
2011-08-26T17:41:00.000Z	spacebug-	scarleo	oh I see. Then it is not how it should work ;/
2011-08-26T17:42:00.000Z	scarleo	spacebug-	Have you seen any bug reports on that matter?
