2006-09-28T05:52:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton		What I'm getting at Ignite, (and I have alot of these games) Is that you don't find alot of Oblivion or HL2, or F.E.A.R. of BF2 level games in Linux
2006-09-28T05:52:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton		And also, in total, you've listed about probably 50% of ALL of the good games in Linux.
2006-09-28T05:53:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton		that are *native* linux.
2006-09-28T05:53:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton		totall: Actually the problem is that *developers* do not port to linux.
2006-09-28T05:54:00.000Z	Emperor_Norton		Linux could handle games absolutely fine, if developers would make ports
2006-09-28T05:54:00.000Z	scheuri	Emperor_Norton	the problem is more...that "devs" are using directx instead of openGL...:)
