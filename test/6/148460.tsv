2005-11-06T17:28:00.000Z	Tesliiny		a stupid bookkeeping stystem :(
2005-11-06T17:28:00.000Z	Tesliiny		consists of MS Acccess document as client and MS SQL server as server
2005-11-06T17:30:00.000Z	anto9us	Tesliiny	have you tried postgresql?
2005-11-06T17:31:00.000Z	anto9us	Tesliiny	provided the backend isn't too complex it makes a good replacement for MSSQL
2005-11-06T17:32:00.000Z	anto9us	Tesliiny	even if it is complex it's very capable it will just take time to port
