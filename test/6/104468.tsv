2006-11-16T07:58:00.000Z	teledyn_		if my microwave is strong enough to disriupt the 802.11 does that mean its leaking a lot of radiation?
2006-11-16T07:59:00.000Z	lullabud	teledyn_	 no, your microwave interrupting your wireless doesn't mean it's leaking too much radiation.
2006-11-16T07:59:00.000Z	teledyn_	lullabud	really?  why would it disrupt it then?
2006-11-16T08:00:00.000Z	lullabud	teledyn_	 because that's what happens with microwaves.  they leak radiation, but it doesn't mean that it's unsafe.
