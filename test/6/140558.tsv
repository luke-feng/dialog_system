2009-01-08T16:43:00.000Z	kiro		Hi, I'm a new Ubuntu user and need some help :D
2009-01-08T16:45:00.000Z	kiro		So I need help installing stepmania... it's a .tar.gz, how do I install it ? I tried sudo apt-get install name.tar.gz but it doesn't find the file

2009-01-08T16:45:00.000Z	Chousuke	kiro	installing it is complicated.
2009-01-08T16:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	kiro	try sudo aptitude install stepmania instead, and see if it's in the repos.
