2007-07-22T09:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Vsop_vsop_vsop_v	well, that because its anrpm package.... compile it from source to make it .deb, or use alien
2007-07-22T09:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Vsop_vsop_vsop_v	step by step of what?
2007-07-22T09:53:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Vsop_vsop_vsop_v	ok, wel,l the basics are, don't download an rpm package
2007-07-22T09:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Vsop_vsop_vsop_v	after that, a basic is, don't compile packages when you're new, find something in the repos, or pre-compiled
2007-07-22T09:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Vsop_vsop_vsop_v	are you using ubuntu?
