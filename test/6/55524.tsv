2008-08-01T15:39:00.000Z	Blaqlight	acemo	the file itself doesn't take up any more space, its just how the filesystem interprets the space available for a certian block of code/text/ whatever.
2008-08-01T15:40:00.000Z	acemo	Blaqlight	so it could be that the files appear to be bigger while there not?
2008-08-01T15:41:00.000Z	Blaqlight	acemo	yes exactly
2008-08-01T15:41:00.000Z	acemo	Blaqlight	great, thanks!
2008-08-01T15:42:00.000Z	Blaqlight	acemo	the filesystem always reads a block as full if something occupies it, whether or not its acually "full"
