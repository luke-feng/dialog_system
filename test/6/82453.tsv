2007-09-06T13:58:00.000Z	TataraKutere		i can't delete it, neither fprot
2007-09-06T13:59:00.000Z	TataraKutere		should it be kept if it's harmless?
2007-09-06T13:59:00.000Z	Creed	TataraKutere	do you have write access enabled on the xp partition? thats prolly why you cant delete it.
2007-09-06T14:00:00.000Z	Creed	TataraKutere	lol dont do anything that will make sure you get infected and youll never be :) I havnt recieved any virus or worm in 2 years, use antivirus software to scan once a month just in case.
