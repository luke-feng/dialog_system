2006-07-25T05:18:00.000Z	Twish`		is is true that ubuntu comes without gtk and qt libraries?
2006-07-25T05:18:00.000Z	crimsun	Twish`	since ubuntu uses gnome, which is based on gtk+, that's highly unlikely.
2006-07-25T05:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Twish`	since kubuntu uses kde, which is based on qt, that's also highly unlikely.
