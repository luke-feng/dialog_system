2007-11-04T04:02:00.000Z	Pelo	nonewmsgs	I don'T think ifo is good for writing to ext3  if you only need to read you probably don't need a fat partitiion,  ubuntu can read/write ntfs
2007-11-04T04:03:00.000Z	Pelo	nonewmsgs	did you use ntfs-config ?
2007-11-04T04:05:00.000Z	Pelo	nonewmsgs	out of my feild of expertise I 'm afraid, sorry
2007-11-04T04:06:00.000Z	Pelo	nonewmsgs	no
2007-11-04T04:06:00.000Z	Pelo	nonewmsgs	fat32
