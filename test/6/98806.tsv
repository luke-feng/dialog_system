2007-02-13T06:37:00.000Z	lasse_	Flannel	ok, will use that one from now on. whats wrong with ubuntuguide.org btw?
2007-02-13T06:37:00.000Z	Flannel	lasse_	some of the stuff it recommends is unsafe
2007-02-13T06:38:00.000Z	lasse_	Flannel	like automatix and stuff?
2007-02-13T06:39:00.000Z	Flannel	lasse_	that's one of a few, yeah.  Some other items are just plain... well, upgrade-breaking.
