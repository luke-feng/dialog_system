2007-09-16T16:06:00.000Z	Rick__	Bossmanbeta	 any like profile stuff (eg: when on batt mode, less power utilisation , etc) any way to like customise
2007-09-16T16:06:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Rick__	betway to keep the batt usage low, is to lower the display brightness.... beyond that, you could set up a go-to-standby after idletime
