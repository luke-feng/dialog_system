2010-09-19T18:24:00.000Z	Seveas	xbonesx	su can only be executed as root or with sudo. It allows the superuser to become someone else. sudo is a more generic way of doing this, usable by non-root users too
2010-09-19T18:24:00.000Z	Seveas	xbonesx	sudo su makes you execute su as root, a fairly pointless action :)
2010-09-19T18:25:00.000Z	Seveas	xbonesx	no, sudo -i
2010-09-19T18:26:00.000Z	xbonesx	Seveas	manpage???
2010-09-19T18:27:00.000Z	Seveas	xbonesx	on the commandline, type this: man sudo
