2004-12-22T17:10:00.000Z	wood1		Well Linux still has about 15 years to catch up with Windows
2004-12-22T17:12:00.000Z	wood1		Well there are costs behind the picture
2004-12-22T17:13:00.000Z	wood1		For example, if all our staffs were made to switch to Linux, the company will have to get fire most of the people or pay the training course for learning Linux
