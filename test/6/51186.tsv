2011-11-05T22:16:00.000Z	surgy		i need help tethering my blackberry using bluetooth i have them paired and when i click on "connect to the internet with this device" it makes a connection in the drop down box, but when i try to connect to it, it flashes for a bit then says "disconnected"
2011-11-05T22:18:00.000Z	surgy		does anyone have any experience tethering a blackberry?
2011-11-05T22:20:00.000Z	surgy		i though this would be an ubuntu support related question since the functionality seams to be built into the operating system
2011-11-05T22:20:00.000Z	bekks	surgy	the OS on the blackberry isnt Ubuntu ;)
2011-11-05T22:21:00.000Z	surgy	bekks	no there is a connect using this device option in the bluetooth options in ubuntu
