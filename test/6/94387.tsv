2012-07-07T18:25:00.000Z	Eisenhorn		Guys, I've installed OpenSUSE a few days back. I didn't like it and wanted to go back. Now I created an bootable ubuntu 12.04 flashdisk and tested it on my homepc to check if it works, which it does. However, when I try to boot from it on my laptop it just continues to the OpenSUSE/grub screen. Is it possible it's interfering somehow?

2012-07-07T18:26:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Eisenhorn	does your laptop bios allow booting from a USB ?
2012-07-07T18:27:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Eisenhorn	ok
