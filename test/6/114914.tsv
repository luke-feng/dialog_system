2008-03-06T03:53:00.000Z	kenro	bruenig	 Cool. I felt so ignored I wasn't getting any activity whatsoever. Even among other people. My connection said there was a problem, I was logged in to my isp, but not connected to the the server. Never assume anything. Extrapolate. After you get the facts.
2008-03-06T03:54:00.000Z	kenro	bruenig	 Got it?
2008-03-06T03:54:00.000Z	bruenig	kenro	I don't have the slightest idea what you are rambling on about, my concern is just for you to stop repeat spam
