Please unmount any logical partitions having a number higher than 5

2008-05-14T13:39:00.000Z	ghindo	charlie_	are you running this off a live CD, or within Ubuntu itself?
2008-05-14T13:40:00.000Z	charlie_	ghindo	live CD
2008-05-14T13:40:00.000Z	ghindo	charlie_	Have you tried doing it with the install disk of Windows, like poweressen recommended?
