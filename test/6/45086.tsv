2009-04-26T02:37:00.000Z	Nook		Of the many things I enjoy doing... one of the highest has  got to be sitting in bed with me EEE.
2009-04-26T02:38:00.000Z	Nook		Oh god, it's true!
2009-04-26T02:39:00.000Z	Nook		Sorry if I'm going on about it. You see, I live in South Africa where the EEE isn't  available. It took 5 weeks to import mine, and I got it 2 days ago. So I'm happy!
2009-04-26T02:41:00.000Z	Nook		Guess what's coming soon? An 8-cell 10500mah battery for me EEE... which should give me around 10.5 hours on Ubuntu ;) *high-five*

2009-04-26T02:42:00.000Z	Nook	usser	Awesome! I gotta import mine, so its about a month to go.
