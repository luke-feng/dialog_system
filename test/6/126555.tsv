2006-08-17T09:39:00.000Z	phiber_optic	BlueEagle	do u have any ideas ?
2006-08-17T09:40:00.000Z	BlueEagle	phiber_optic	I'm sorry? About what?
2006-08-17T09:41:00.000Z	BlueEagle	phiber_optic	How are you for power? Is your PSU (Power Supply Unit) powerful enough to handle all your devices? With a P4 and a nVidia card and a couple of hard drives you really want in excess of 400W.
2006-08-17T09:43:00.000Z	BlueEagle	phiber_optic	Well I had trouble with one old drive (segate iirc) when I was running short on power. Keept messing up my data.
