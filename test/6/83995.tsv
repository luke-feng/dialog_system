2007-08-05T10:37:00.000Z	BlainN	john__	Not flaming.  I just would like to see any piece of software that required no support.
2007-08-05T10:38:00.000Z	john__	BlainN	you have a good point, but offering support as the core of your business model just doesn't seem ideal to me, that's all i meant.
2007-08-05T10:39:00.000Z	BlainN	john__	I just think it's a sign that you're offering a valuable product that's useful to a lot of people ,and some percentage are going to be willing to pay for some handholding or customization.
