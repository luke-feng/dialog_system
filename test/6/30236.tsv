2010-04-29T23:55:00.000Z	ToXedVirus		Since the compilers optimize, I bet tarring and untarring is fater
2010-04-29T23:56:00.000Z	ToXedVirus		not bad, the apache 64bit  is godlike
2010-04-29T23:58:00.000Z	ToXedVirus		Hm, too bad the x264 encoding performance is just slightly better
2010-04-29T23:58:00.000Z	ToXedVirus		they could have done a better job
