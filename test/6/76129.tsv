2012-11-19T11:31:00.000Z	Mechdave	jdpeck	I have had trouble with 12.04 with getting the compilation to work with the android source. I know the guys here say 12.04 for everything but personally I have had nothing but trouble when it comes to compiling android on it. If set up correctly 10.04 works well
