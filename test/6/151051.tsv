2006-10-02T13:40:00.000Z	yigal		hi - who can help me with ICQ installing on Ubuntu?
2006-10-02T13:40:00.000Z	afrosheen	yigal	you can use Gaim or Trillian or anything else
2006-10-02T13:42:00.000Z	afrosheen	yigal	there will be account setups regardless
2006-10-02T13:43:00.000Z	afrosheen	yigal	http://www.icq.com/download/icq2go/ is probably what you'd prefer
2006-10-02T13:43:00.000Z	afrosheen	yigal	it's java-based and zero install
2006-10-02T13:45:00.000Z	afrosheen	yigal	again, there is a web-based msn client
