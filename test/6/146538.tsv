2005-09-18T16:08:00.000Z	vbgunz		it's about the only thing that fails
2005-09-18T16:09:00.000Z	vbgunz		goodnight
2005-09-18T16:10:00.000Z	vbgunz		so how would I fix this issue? It doesn't seem to be a major problem or even a tinsy weeny one... Just it bothers me when Ubuntu is loading I see that fail in red... Any ideas?
