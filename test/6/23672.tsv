2011-07-09T07:10:00.000Z	UABob		Now...sound....I've got an Asus A8N32 SLI Deluxe board (old system, I know) with onboard realtek AC97 audio. Ubuntu 11.04, fresh install. Audio just doesn't work--period.
2011-07-09T07:10:00.000Z	UABob		Speakers work, volume's up, it's unmuted.
2011-07-09T07:10:00.000Z	UABob		Just....no audio
2011-07-09T07:10:00.000Z	UABob		any place to start?
