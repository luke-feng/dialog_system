2010-12-27T10:57:00.000Z	Gilos		I just found a ubuntu based distro that I'm trying in virtual box to see if I like it.  Ultimate-Edition
2010-12-27T10:57:00.000Z	shingen	Gilos	ultimate edition is so loaded with crap, it's bloatware :)
2010-12-27T10:58:00.000Z	Gilos	clausen	I will try that out again, I haven't tried it in 10.10, I think it was 8.x that I last tried the icons on the side (before I try cario)
2010-12-27T10:59:00.000Z	Gilos		it's nice seeing what all you can do with themes and all the bloat, maybe I will leave it in a virtualbox and pick out what I like and add it to my non-virtual
2010-12-27T11:00:00.000Z	shingen	Gilos	yeah, instal ultamix or whatever their installer is, so you can pick and choose the bloat :)
