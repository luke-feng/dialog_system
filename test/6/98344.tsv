2008-07-07T19:51:00.000Z	ScaryFast		yeah, I joined another server
2008-07-07T19:52:00.000Z	ScaryFast		in mirc in windows I can hit F1 and it runs a script and joins 2 servers and a dozen channels
2008-07-07T19:52:00.000Z	ScaryFast		I guess I just miss that :P
2008-07-07T19:52:00.000Z	ScaryFast		yes
2008-07-07T19:53:00.000Z	ScaryFast		or I could reboot and see why mirc under wine crashes when I try to use the edit script window :P
2008-07-07T19:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	ScaryFast	why would you use mirc in wine?... thats silly,
