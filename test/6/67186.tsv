2008-09-14T12:53:00.000Z	LurkersA	noremorse	I believe it does, and yes it will uncompress .tar.gz tarballs
2008-09-14T12:54:00.000Z	LurkersA	noremorse	Depends if you fo a complete install or a wubi install
2008-09-14T12:55:00.000Z	LurkersA	noremorse	You can trial a fully operating Ubuntu install with a wubi install, which sort of installs it under windows
2008-09-14T13:01:00.000Z	LurkersA	noremorse	Stick the disk in when you are in windows
2008-09-14T13:05:00.000Z	LurkersA	noremorse	Ubuntu is a linux variant
