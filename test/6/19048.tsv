2012-03-12T20:02:00.000Z	nishttal2	sipior	can you point me to a link that i can read up about lvm
2012-03-12T20:03:00.000Z	sipior	nishttal2	for starters: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/40702/how-to-manage-and-use-lvm-logical-volume-management-in-ubuntu/

2012-03-12T20:08:00.000Z	sipior	nishttal2	well, that makes your decision very simple :-)
