2007-02-20T07:37:00.000Z	P4ndaman		the alternative one
2007-02-20T07:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	P4ndaman	eminently doable
2007-02-20T07:41:00.000Z	Frogzoo	P4ndaman	if you want to suspend, 1.5x ram
2007-02-20T07:43:00.000Z	P4ndaman	Frogzoo	what do you mean by suspend?
2007-02-20T07:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	P4ndaman	suspend means hibernate only if you're sloppy in  your terminology, my bad
