The fsck should be performed in maintenance mode with the root filesystem mounted in read-only mode. i have now idea what this means. it was caused by a "routine check of drives /dev/sda1" can anyone help me???

2008-04-30T22:56:00.000Z	weaseal	bigtimer121	i dunno how to do it manually on linux...i haven't had that problem yet in linux. try googling for the terms 'manual fsck ubuntu'
2008-04-30T22:57:00.000Z	weaseal	bigtimer121	that error is typically caused by either a bad disk, or you shut the computer down when it was busy, perhaps your power went out, etc
