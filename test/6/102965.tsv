2006-12-01T15:28:00.000Z	justin_	nofxx	No real point in upgrading anyways.. ;D
2006-12-01T15:29:00.000Z	justin_	nofxx	By the way.. I think you can update to 6.10 simply by Synaptic
2006-12-01T15:29:00.000Z	nofxx	justin_	.. but it'll be another 700mb
2006-12-01T15:29:00.000Z	justin_	nofxx	No.. it will simply update the parts.. most things stayed the same.
2006-12-01T15:30:00.000Z	nofxx	justin_	 hahah you did'nt it yourself....more then 500mb i'm sure
