2005-10-31T12:20:00.000Z	vureal		oh do you guys know off the top of your head, to delete a program in linux, you can just rm the binary and the etc folder right?
2005-10-31T12:20:00.000Z	vureal		oh.... what if you compiled the program, then synaptic will not work
2005-10-31T12:22:00.000Z	vureal		and if you have deleted the ./configure file and the install file just cuz you are stupid enough to think that you don't need the source right after you install your stuff
2005-10-31T12:22:00.000Z	vureal		what would you do?
2005-10-31T12:23:00.000Z	CarlFK___	vureal	- I would just leave it installed
