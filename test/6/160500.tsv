2005-02-10T10:48:00.000Z	giard	hypa7ia	sound needs to get fixed... it looks like the alsa settings aren't being set automatically
2005-02-10T10:48:00.000Z	hypa7ia	giard	sounds about right
2005-02-10T10:48:00.000Z	giard	hypa7ia	if you go to the mixer and change it from oss to alsa and back, you might have some luck
