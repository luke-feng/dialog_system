2007-12-28T01:14:00.000Z	bardyr	zcat[1]	not if he used the latest envy with dkms support
2007-12-28T01:15:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bardyr	any reason not to just use nvidia-glx-new? It's the same driver, but packaged so it doesn't get broken every time other packages are updated
2007-12-28T01:16:00.000Z	bardyr	zcat[1]	its not the same, its very old
2007-12-28T01:16:00.000Z	bardyr	zcat[1]	-new means the new cards and a new driver version
2007-12-28T01:17:00.000Z	bardyr	zcat[1]	new cards not new driver version*
