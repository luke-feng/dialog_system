2006-11-08T06:58:00.000Z	Moltov		Anyone want to try to help me get my wireless card working...? please?... its a Linksys Wusb54g v1(Not v4, meaning the wusb54g stickied topic in the forums is kinda useless)
2006-11-08T06:59:00.000Z	Moltov		because getting help from someone whos good at more than one would be insane then mortin
2006-11-08T07:00:00.000Z	motin	Moltov	but now almost noone getes help - everything drowns
2006-11-08T07:00:00.000Z	motin	Moltov	well - the noobs wont se it, and they need the help
2006-11-08T07:02:00.000Z	motin	Moltov	because then others couldnt help out together
2006-11-08T07:03:00.000Z	motin	Moltov	look like now - how likely is it that my problem is recognized - already three screens up?
