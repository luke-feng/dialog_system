2006-04-26T06:43:00.000Z	noonex	muraii	i have it all set up and i'm using it and all, but rythmbox keeps poping up when i plug the ipod in, and its annoying :)
2006-04-26T06:43:00.000Z	muraii	noonex	I wonder if it's in the Gnome "preferred applications" setup?
2006-04-26T06:44:00.000Z	muraii	noonex	But, to be honest, I don't use any audio apps on my Linux machine.
2006-04-26T06:45:00.000Z	noonex	muraii	thanks for the help too!
