2005-11-26T17:58:00.000Z	saik0	LjL	you're not using all the gnome-libs
2005-11-26T17:58:00.000Z	LjL	saik0	i suppose you're using most, though
2005-11-26T17:59:00.000Z	saik0	LjL	not really, you would be surprised
2005-11-26T17:59:00.000Z	LjL	saik0	well, i dunno, i use KDE myself
2005-11-26T17:59:00.000Z	LjL	saik0	anyway, for starters, apps will take longer to start, as the libs must be loaded
