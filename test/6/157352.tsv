2005-02-11T15:22:00.000Z	timothy		how can I install a C compiler in ubuntu? (is there one on the install CD that I just missed that I can easily install?)
2005-02-11T15:23:00.000Z	aToaster	timothy	doesn't gcc come with ubuntu?
2005-02-11T15:23:00.000Z	timothy	aToaster	I thought so, but when I tried to install a version of gaim it told me that there wasn't a valid C compiler...
2005-02-11T15:23:00.000Z	timothy	aToaster	configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
2005-02-11T15:24:00.000Z	aToaster	timothy	run synaptic package manager and install gcc
2005-02-11T15:24:00.000Z	aToaster	timothy	if it's not there that is
