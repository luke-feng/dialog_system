2005-09-30T15:12:00.000Z	angryfix	hondje	perfect! thanks.
2005-09-30T15:12:00.000Z	hondje	angryfix	No problem :) The setting to have it on my default is on the server you're ssh'd to, so to make it permanant you have to mess with the config there
2005-09-30T15:13:00.000Z	angryfix	hondje	what about enabling the color background?
2005-09-30T15:14:00.000Z	hondje	angryfix	I can't remember how to do that...I always just set the syntax to dark bg and forget about it
