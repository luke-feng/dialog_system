2007-05-17T11:06:00.000Z	jebus		I have a harddrive with windows on it and with empty space. I want to install on the empty space. I should use manual partitioning in the install, yes?
2007-05-17T11:07:00.000Z	bluecat9	jebus	just run Feisty and choose guided install
2007-05-17T11:07:00.000Z	jebus	bluecat9	it is feisty, but I'm not sure I trust the "use largest free space"
2007-05-17T11:08:00.000Z	bluecat9	jebus	i've used that method twice without issue
2007-05-17T11:08:00.000Z	jebus	bluecat9	the "use free disk space"
2007-05-17T11:08:00.000Z	bluecat9	jebus	yes
