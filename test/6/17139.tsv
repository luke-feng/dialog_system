2010-09-17T22:48:00.000Z	maedox	adalal	you're probably best off with doing a boot repair with a windows cd.
2010-09-17T22:49:00.000Z	adalal	maedox	the computer comes with a recovery partition, not a windows cd, will that work?
2010-09-17T22:49:00.000Z	maedox	adalal	it might, just make sure you don't overwrite your installation.
2010-09-17T22:50:00.000Z	maedox	adalal	why would you want your windows mbr back? o_O
2010-09-17T22:52:00.000Z	maedox	adalal	you could probably legally download one if you have a license. if you don't no one cares anyway. :D
