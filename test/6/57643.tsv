I have a problem with my system that when I start it, non of the loading bar and the configuration output (starting servers, applications, checking system ...) appear. instead, I get a dim back screen with a very little light and then logs in the system normally after 3 minutes! Can anyone predict what's wrong?

2008-05-16T13:51:00.000Z	natalisushka		<bazhang> I don't know how and what to fix! that's why I am here
