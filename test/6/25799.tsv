2010-01-06T09:20:00.000Z	shudder	ghostnik11	I haven't been able to get it to work yet
2010-01-06T09:21:00.000Z	ghostnik11	shudder	is it possible or have you read anything that allows s3 savage to work with compiz
2010-01-06T09:21:00.000Z	shudder	ghostnik11	no, but I haven't looked around too hard either since it isn't really my thing
2010-01-06T09:22:00.000Z	ghostnik11	shudder	thats the thing i am not good with stuff like that but in the wikipedia that i read online it said it was compatible with compiz
2010-01-06T09:22:00.000Z	shudder	ghostnik11	I wouldn't be surpised but it will probably be patchy
