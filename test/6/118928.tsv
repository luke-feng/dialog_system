2006-05-12T07:15:00.000Z	Tylerofl		how do you use a .run file?
2006-05-12T07:15:00.000Z	_jason	Tylerofl	generally you execute it, but what is it a .run of?
2006-05-12T07:17:00.000Z	Tylerofl	_jason	it is a .run of nvidia display drivers
2006-05-12T07:17:00.000Z	_jason	Tylerofl	it is better (and easier) if you follow the wiki instructions that I just had ubotu send you
2006-05-12T07:18:00.000Z	Tylerofl	_jason	thanks
