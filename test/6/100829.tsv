2007-02-15T08:36:00.000Z	Sanne	linux_kid	thanks, but wasn't much effort really, I'm drawn to that stuff (and sorry for offtopic...)
2007-02-15T08:37:00.000Z	linux_kid	Sanne	tell that to ALL of your gfs
2007-02-15T08:38:00.000Z	Sanne	linux_kid	I'd love to have more females with whom to talk computer and linux. More males also, for that matter. But there's always the 'net ;)
2007-02-15T08:38:00.000Z	linux_kid	Sanne	we're in a half-perfect world :)
2007-02-15T08:39:00.000Z	Sanne	linux_kid	yeah :)
