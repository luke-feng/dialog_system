2009-10-10T10:07:00.000Z	DrGenius		thx for ur help, but i'm not reading a 13 chapter book with 4 appendices just to mount this crap
2009-10-10T10:08:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DrGenius	then I'd kill the raid0  and change it to JBOD
2009-10-10T10:09:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DrGenius	with 1TB USB's going for under $100, that isn't a problem :)
2009-10-10T10:10:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DrGenius	I think your trolling
2009-10-10T10:11:00.000Z	Jeruvy	DrGenius	because you are not factual, your pendantic
