2010-05-09T00:47:00.000Z	brad__		Hey all
2010-05-09T00:47:00.000Z	brad__		I stupidly tried to install Plasma in gnome for kicks
2010-05-09T00:47:00.000Z	brad__		and it has borked apt/dpkg
2010-05-09T00:47:00.000Z	brad__		So I cannot install/unistall anything
2010-05-09T00:47:00.000Z	maco	brad__	you can run plasma widgets in a plasma viewer. and it shouldnt have broken apt
2010-05-09T00:48:00.000Z	maco	brad__	cuz having kde and gnome installed simultaneously is just fne
