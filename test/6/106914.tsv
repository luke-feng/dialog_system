2007-04-23T13:06:00.000Z	b^j	soundray	i though of that, any idea if it would handle 30 some connections?
2007-04-23T13:06:00.000Z	soundray	b^j	I can't imagine it being much of a problem.
2007-04-23T13:06:00.000Z	soundray	b^j	that's not to say I've tried, though.
2007-04-23T13:07:00.000Z	b^j	soundray	not a huge vnc fan, will have to give it a try
