2008-01-10T22:39:00.000Z	Xima1		I can't get the directory to work period ... for my install of vmware
2008-01-10T22:48:00.000Z	yango	Xima1	I have done exactly what I told you, and have my VMWare 6 working... anyhow the 5.5 couldn't build the modules in edgy and above
2008-01-10T22:48:00.000Z	yango	Xima1	so, if it's original, you should contact VMWare to get a module for 5.5 that works in an old kernel
2008-01-10T22:49:00.000Z	Xima1		i got it...
2008-01-10T22:49:00.000Z	yango	Xima1	got what?
