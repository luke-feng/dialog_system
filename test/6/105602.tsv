2006-10-03T07:51:00.000Z	spunk_		Hello all, which package gives me a standard development environment (i.e., gcc, stdlib, etc.)?
2006-10-03T07:51:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	spunk_	build-essential
2006-10-03T07:51:00.000Z	spunk_	wickedpuppy	thanks!
2006-10-03T07:54:00.000Z	spunk_	wickedpuppy	hm, build-essential seems to be aimed at installing an environment for package development. Is there any package for misc. development?
2006-10-03T07:55:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	spunk_	gcc is in build-essential ..
2006-10-03T07:56:00.000Z	spunk_	wickedpuppy	Dr_willis ok, I'll go for build-essential. thanks!
