2007-10-19T00:22:00.000Z	M_WS		2 days ago I got rid of windows and installed Ubuntu on my laptop - now it doesn't find my wireless network (it does find other networks, just not mine) I'm considering switching back to windows. But before that, I would like to know if there is anything else that could cause it not finding my network. Any ideas?

2007-10-19T00:23:00.000Z	M_WS	thyagobr	IÂ´m pretty sure i switched it on in the firmware
2007-10-19T00:24:00.000Z	thyagobr	M_WS	i mean the notebook switch... but that probably isnt the case very often =P
2007-10-19T00:24:00.000Z	M_WS	thyagobr	yeah, it picks up other networks
2007-10-19T00:24:00.000Z	thyagobr	M_WS	oh, i see
