2007-01-16T15:05:00.000Z	johan__		are there any non-GPL application bundled within ubuntu?
2007-01-16T15:06:00.000Z	johan__		if yes which one
2007-01-16T15:06:00.000Z	lupine_85	johan__	the X server?
2007-01-16T15:10:00.000Z	lupine_85	johan__	then there's an abundance. but it smells like homework to me.
