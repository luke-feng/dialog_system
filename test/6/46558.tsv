2009-09-20T08:25:00.000Z	n8tuser	mdg_	-> i was told there is a driver for it, maybe you have to pay
2009-09-20T08:29:00.000Z	n8tuser	mdg_	-> geesh one can not read a linux partition from windows easily, you are not accepting of that?
2009-09-20T08:29:00.000Z	mdg_	n8tuser	I asked him if he can see any partitions from within windows
2009-09-20T08:30:00.000Z	n8tuser	mdg_	-> he is confused and not understanding things, you kept feeding him
2009-09-20T08:31:00.000Z	mdg_	n8tuser	I think we are all confused  ;)
