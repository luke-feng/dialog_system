2009-07-04T22:54:00.000Z	mneptok	freeanshu	why do you need the latest kernel?
2009-07-04T22:55:00.000Z	mneptok	freeanshu	not a good enough reason to risk breaking your entire installation.
2009-07-04T22:56:00.000Z	freeanshu	mneptok	thanks
2009-07-04T22:56:00.000Z	freeanshu	mneptok	i thought there is no risk
