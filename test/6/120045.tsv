2006-04-26T05:36:00.000Z	blindx		I'm on gnome
2006-04-26T05:37:00.000Z	blindx		they're both fat rofl
2006-04-26T05:37:00.000Z	blindx		Well I was just wondering if there anything more than a cosmetic difference between the two..
2006-04-26T05:38:00.000Z	blindx		cause I have simplyMEPIS on my other box, and it has KDE on it.
