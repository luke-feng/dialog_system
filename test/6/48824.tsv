2008-10-30T23:54:00.000Z	not_jrib	amerinese	that's nspluginwrapper crashing.  Apparently, it's supposed to restart on its own in 8.10 if you want to upgrade and try
2008-10-30T23:55:00.000Z	amerinese		hmm, ok, so i guess... i'm uneasy about upgrading because i have dual-monitors, but we'll see
2008-10-30T23:56:00.000Z	not_jrib	amerinese	test out a live cd first.  But I imagine you should be fine.  X is newer and better :)
