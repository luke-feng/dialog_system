2011-03-29T23:25:00.000Z	JJ_		Ok. for anyone alive out there, I am a windows user fed up of Microsoft's monopoly and lack of security. Can anyone tell me this much: OK, I try to use the Ubuntu Clam AV, but for some reason, it is out of date and won't update. Any help here?
2011-03-29T23:27:00.000Z	JJ_		Ok, then lets say for some reason I was clicking on a link to a site and it redirected me to a windows virus, I know they do not run on Linux, but how would I get the sucker out of Linux?
2011-03-29T23:28:00.000Z	JJ_		And how would I know what to delete?
2011-03-29T23:29:00.000Z	JJ_		Its not like the virus magically tells you what the file name is.
2011-03-29T23:30:00.000Z	JJ_		what is "!virus"? A command?
2011-03-29T23:30:00.000Z	maco	JJ_	its an instruction for the channel's bot (ubottu)
