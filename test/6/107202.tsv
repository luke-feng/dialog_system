2006-09-08T12:55:00.000Z	robin_sz		well, I live in hope.

2006-09-08T12:57:00.000Z	robin_sz	gnomefreak	sounds easy enough ... somewhat easier than im used to!
2006-09-08T12:57:00.000Z	gnomefreak	robin_sz	make sure multiverse repo is enabled and go for it
2006-09-08T12:58:00.000Z	gnomefreak	robin_sz	sun-java5-plugin installs plugin -bin -jre
