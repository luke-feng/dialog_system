2008-05-24T20:40:00.000Z	jardi		﻿I have an issue concerning some partitions that are shown on the desktop wheras I want to hide them. Theses partitions are mounted on directories like /home/<user>/Music and I want to navigate to theses directories without noticing I'm on another partition. I've made some fdi rules to have hal set the volume.ignore option to true for these partitions but nautilis still put them on my desktop. What can I do ?
