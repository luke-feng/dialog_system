2011-10-15T09:18:00.000Z	ghostnik11		the one where you know the day of the week and the clock and u click on it and calender comes down, well can thunderbird calender be integrated into that or no?
2011-10-15T09:19:00.000Z	phiscibe	ghostnik11	that is some type of widget or something
2011-10-15T09:23:00.000Z	phiscibe	ghostnik11	you can always find the program you were used to and add it back
2011-10-15T09:24:00.000Z	ghostnik11	phiscibe	thanks will just uninstall thunderbird and install evolution like you guys suggested, almoxarife1: will definetly do that just felt that there was a reason ubuntu team would take it out b/c they felt thunderbird was better or more advance meaning it would be good for everyone, reisio
