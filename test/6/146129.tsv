2009-09-06T18:26:00.000Z	yeldud		I am having problems reading MS docs with open office; any advice?
2009-09-06T18:26:00.000Z	jake	yeldud	what is the problem exactly
2009-09-06T18:28:00.000Z	jake	yeldud	you saved a file at work using MS office and then you saved it on to a pen drive. Now you can't open it using Open Office - is this correct?
2009-09-06T18:29:00.000Z	jake	yeldud	what version of open office do you use?
2009-09-06T18:31:00.000Z	jake	yeldud	you may have saved it in new the docx format for ms office - you will need to update your open office to 3.0
2009-09-06T18:32:00.000Z	jake	yeldud	2.4 has a compatability pack that works in debian from what i know - but 3.0 will work with that format
