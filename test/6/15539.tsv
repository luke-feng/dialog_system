2010-10-30T15:43:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	printf_1	have you tried native linux programs for audio editing, eg. Ardour & Muse?
2010-10-30T15:44:00.000Z	printf_1	sinisterstuf	Ardour was difficult for me to understand last time I tried it, I'll look at it again.
2010-10-30T15:44:00.000Z	printf_1		Never heard of Muse before.
2010-10-30T15:46:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	printf_1	ardour will be easy to work with if you≈ïe familiar with the Windows program called Pro Tools
