2010-06-02T07:26:00.000Z	R3cur51v3		That's ridiculous.
2010-06-02T07:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	R3cur51v3	It was more than two posts

2010-07-22T05:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	R3cur51v3	I recommend that you do *NOT* use testdisk or photorec on the drive itself, use gddrescue to create an image first.
2010-07-22T05:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	R3cur51v3	gddrescue will get as much data as possible while preventing as much further damage as possible, I would use it before doing anything else with the drive.
