2007-04-24T13:03:00.000Z	sherlock		tatster: did you look at /etc/resolve.conf
2007-04-24T13:04:00.000Z	sherlock		then upgrade to feisty
2007-04-24T13:05:00.000Z	tatster_	sherlock	Yes - the only difference is that the Mac doesn't have an entry for domain
2007-04-24T13:05:00.000Z	tatster_	sherlock	they both have nameserver 192.168.02.53  and search warren.local
2007-04-24T13:08:00.000Z	tatster_	sherlock	I might pop over to a Bind channel and see what response I get there.  Thanks
