2010-10-18T16:32:00.000Z	ForgeAus	slidinghorn	his line wasn't too bad
2010-10-18T16:33:00.000Z	slidinghorn	ForgeAus	 there was no mention of a problem, and he was asking to have it done in PM -- we need it done in the room so people who may have the same problem can find it via search engines
2010-10-18T16:34:00.000Z	ForgeAus	slidinghorn	he probably wanted PM so that he could concentrate/read it without all the other "junk" of other support convos happening at the same time
2010-10-18T16:34:00.000Z	ForgeAus	slidinghorn	and personally I don't blame him ... (or her?)
2010-10-18T16:35:00.000Z	slidinghorn		there's always the -beginners channel :)  less crowded
2010-10-18T16:35:00.000Z	ForgeAus	slidinghorn	there are some people that can't deal with multiple chats, I'm thankful I'm not one of them :)
