2005-10-20T07:15:00.000Z	chris_bloke	ryanduff	no root password, use "sudo" instead
2005-10-20T07:17:00.000Z	chris_bloke	ryanduff	root account is locked by default
2005-10-20T07:17:00.000Z	chris_bloke	ryanduff	you can just do "sudo passwd" to set a root password if you need it
2005-10-20T07:18:00.000Z	ryanduff	chris_bloke	thanks
2005-10-20T07:19:00.000Z	chris_bloke	ryanduff	I believe so
