2011-02-25T22:34:00.000Z	sgo11		hi, I used ecryptfs-manager to Add passphrase key to keyring. but the keyring lost after reboot. is this expected? (using ubuntu)

2011-02-25T22:36:00.000Z	sgo11	Dr_Willis	iceroot, thanks. that means I do not need to umount it manually. shutdown will take care of it. thanks.
