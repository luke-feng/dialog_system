2008-10-10T10:59:00.000Z	abchirk	macvr	why you should get some when you use picasa?
2008-10-10T11:01:00.000Z	abchirk	macvr	hm when you download viruses maybe, but I don't guess that picase has viruses...
2008-10-10T11:02:00.000Z	abchirk	macvr	there won't be viruses only with wine.
2008-10-10T11:06:00.000Z	abchirk	macvr	sure if you get an .exe which deletes all your data it will be whereever it has writepermissions :)
