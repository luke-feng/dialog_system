2012-07-26T01:34:00.000Z	CIDR		just installed ubuntu 12.04, and grabbed chrome, any ideas why flash pages like pandora or youtube would be basically unusable and lag the hell out of everything
2012-07-26T01:35:00.000Z	CIDR		I installed 12.04, cleanly.  Downloaded and installed chrome.
2012-07-26T01:36:00.000Z	CIDR		Now pandora is slow and lags my entire system if i open it in chrome, and youtube is about useless as it plays funky speeds

2012-07-26T01:36:00.000Z	CIDR	bluebomber	 but not why flash doesn't work
2012-07-26T01:37:00.000Z	bluebomber	CIDR	Well, why Flash "doesn't work" is a whole 'nother discussion, I'm afraid. ;-)
