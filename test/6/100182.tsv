2007-03-29T06:54:00.000Z	genii		I actually have somewhere a Solaris version of IE5
2007-03-29T06:56:00.000Z	kambei	genii	You can run IE on Debian.
2007-03-29T06:56:00.000Z	genii	kambei	I'm talking of a native Unix IE, not under some emulator
2007-03-29T06:56:00.000Z	kambei	genii	Why would you want to?
2007-03-29T07:03:00.000Z	genii	kambei	I wouldn't actually particularly want to. But just the idea is intriguing. Then for instance you could use IETab extensions from Firefox and such
2007-03-29T07:03:00.000Z	kambei	genii	Hrm.
