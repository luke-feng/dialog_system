2008-06-29T22:27:00.000Z	phasegen	SebNaitsabes	I like evolution, it works fine, just since hardy it asks for my password everytime I start it.  Not the mail server password, my password
2008-06-29T22:30:00.000Z	phasegen	SebNaitsabes	The weird thing is, when I changed my password, evolution still wants the old one
2008-06-29T22:31:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	phasegen	I dont' use evolotion
