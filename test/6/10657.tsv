2011-04-11T14:40:00.000Z	s0phi3	Morgz	testing my sound with Phonon yields sound in the headphones, but my issue is that no sound works from my browser
2011-04-11T14:41:00.000Z	Morgz	s0phi3	- not sure, but it sounds like your browser doesn't use the default output. either use system-sound or look through the sound settings in the browser for the problem
2011-04-11T14:43:00.000Z	s0phi3	Morgz	i know nothing about system-sound or how to look through sound settings in Firefox :/
