2009-07-03T01:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	threethirty	 check the conky homepage/configs - they got examples of doing that stuff..  you may need to set the  min/max sizes of the 'conky' window manually

2009-07-03T01:16:00.000Z	threethirty	Dr_Willis	my old conky config fit the whole screen and i just removed some of the sections, shouldnt the window size still be the same (and how are you starting multiple conkies?)
