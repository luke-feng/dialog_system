2012-08-06T06:41:00.000Z	escapeplan		I need some serious help with Docky, I want it to intellihide, but I'm doing this from a MadBox OS (ubuntu with openbox) and it just does not seem to work out, can I do this the harder way ?

2012-08-06T06:42:00.000Z	theadmin	escapeplan	Maybe they have their own channel?
2012-08-06T06:43:00.000Z	theadmin	escapeplan	Also do you have xcompmgr enabled? Might need that for those fancy docks...
2012-08-06T06:43:00.000Z	theadmin	escapeplan	Well, or any other compositing manager.
2012-08-06T06:45:00.000Z	theadmin	escapeplan	Good luck, because I don't have any suggestions but that.
