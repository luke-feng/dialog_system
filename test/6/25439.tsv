2010-01-13T04:22:00.000Z	zynox	shane2peru	vlc
2010-01-13T04:22:00.000Z	shane2peru	zynox	vlc complains and doesn't play it
2010-01-13T04:23:00.000Z	zynox	shane2peru	then the .wmv probably has some drm in there.
2010-01-13T04:24:00.000Z	shane2peru	zynox	does that mean I cannot play it?  it is posted on a web site it is original content for anyone to play
2010-01-13T04:24:00.000Z	shane2peru	zynox	probably misformated rather than dmr or drm stuff
