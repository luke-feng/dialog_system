2008-09-21T17:03:00.000Z	asho79	jamus	that command doesn´t seem to do anything
2008-09-21T17:04:00.000Z	asho79	jamus	yeah, but that is all
2008-09-21T17:09:00.000Z	asho79	jamus	update manager or update notifier
2008-09-21T17:11:00.000Z	asho79	jamus	ahh, it´s cool. I´ll just manually do it when it needs doing. Notifier works, tells me when there´s stuff to get
2008-09-21T17:14:00.000Z	asho79	jamus	I use windows at work but they´d save a heap of money on linux
