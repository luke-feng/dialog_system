2007-12-10T01:43:00.000Z	rob3r		I'm looking to buy some ear/headphones, just wondering if anyone has some suggestions on USB ones that work well, or if you just got jack general suggestions on what you like would be appreciated
2007-12-10T01:43:00.000Z	rob3r		I'm running 7.10
2007-12-10T01:44:00.000Z	Weng	rob3r	I've always had success with whatever headsets Logitech is selling around the $15 pricerange at any given moment. But those ain't USB.
2007-12-10T01:45:00.000Z	rob3r	Weng	you can just plug 'em in and go? I am working on a long ass paper for school and want to quick go out and grab a pair of head phones so I can listen to music at a cofeeshop, I don't have time to mess around : )
2007-12-10T01:45:00.000Z	Weng	rob3r	Yep. Assuming your sound card works, anyway.
2007-12-10T01:46:00.000Z	rob3r	Weng	yeah, soundcard works great. Thanks a lot, I'll just go  with a jack headphone then
