2010-01-09T03:32:00.000Z	adam_g		where does aptitude store its install/post install scripts? id like to see what will happen in post-inst for 'apt-get install kunbuntu-desktop'
2010-01-09T03:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	adam_g	those scripts com in the deb package afaik
2010-07-01T22:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	adam_g	use another keyserver
2010-07-01T22:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	adam_g	pgp.mit.edu
2010-07-01T22:33:00.000Z	adam_g	erUSUL	how does one tell add-apt-repository to query that server instead of the default?  i can add key manually with gpg but apt-add-repository still tries fetching it
2010-07-01T22:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	adam_g	really dunno; add-apt-repository has no option to change server.
