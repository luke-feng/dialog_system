2004-10-20T07:18:00.000Z	stianh		how many fulltime devs does ubuntu have?
2004-10-20T07:18:00.000Z	stianh		I am writing an article in norwegian about ubuntu, so I hope you won't mind me asking a few general questions :)
2004-10-20T07:19:00.000Z	Mithrandir	stianh	for whom?
2004-10-20T07:19:00.000Z	stianh	Mithrandir	no one specific, but there is one norwegian linux site that I am thinking of submitting it to, and maybe a printed magazine, but chances are highest on it beeing published on the website.
2004-10-20T07:20:00.000Z	Mithrandir	stianh	which one, then.
2004-10-20T07:21:00.000Z	stianh	Mithrandir	www.linux1.no, and if they won't take it I'll try my luck with Linuxmagasinet (www.linmag.no) which is the printed one
