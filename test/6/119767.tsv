2010-11-04T16:40:00.000Z	coz_	kwagner	 yeah hold on
2010-11-04T16:41:00.000Z	coz_	kwagner	 yeah there is no live cd server
2010-11-04T16:41:00.000Z	coz_	kwagner	 you caught me on that one lol
2010-11-04T16:42:00.000Z	coz_	kwagner	  you might be better off with the minimal install cd    ,, from there you can install the server
2010-11-04T16:43:00.000Z	coz_	kwagner	  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD   if you download and burn that,,, at one point it will give you a list of install options... use the arrow keys to scroll the list and the Space  bar to tick a box... the server editions are on that list
