2009-10-22T18:11:00.000Z	fjordlord	Bob_Dole2	yea but it works alot better now!
2009-10-22T18:12:00.000Z	fjordlord	Bob_Dole2	before this update it was lagging terrible couldnt even watch videos on youtube
2009-10-22T18:12:00.000Z	Bob_Dole2	fjordlord	That's good to hear. I hope to see worth-while flash soon then
