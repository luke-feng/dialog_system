2010-05-19T16:38:00.000Z	xro_	ActionParsnip	what do you mean?
2010-05-19T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xro_	i use dnsmasq, so the resolution etc has been added to the services config
2010-05-19T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xro_	makes webbrowsing slightly faster as I keep all resolutions local rather than consulting the web every time

2010-05-19T16:44:00.000Z	xro_	ActionParsnip	so you don't get any answer (nothing in answer section)... Is that mean --> no, PTR entry in the dns server?
