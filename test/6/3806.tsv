2012-04-27T03:07:00.000Z	monotoko		alright people... I need to know if I can trust the QQ Linux client? I have a meeting with a chinese client and they will only use QQ >.>
2012-04-27T03:08:00.000Z	monotoko		it's all in chinese... but as long as I can navigate my way to chat I should be okay... however I just wanted to know if I can trust it
2012-04-27T03:09:00.000Z	liberal	monotoko	you can't use a segregated VM that will be deleted immediately afterwards?
2012-04-27T03:09:00.000Z	liberal		simple solution if you're paranoid about it.
2012-04-27T03:09:00.000Z	monotoko	liberal	I could but the hardware support isn't so good for a video call... I just don't trust a chinese company in a communist state with root access to my machine...
2012-04-27T03:10:00.000Z	monotoko	liberal	from what I've heard... it wants root access every time it's run
