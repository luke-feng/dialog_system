2008-10-16T08:21:00.000Z	Kristie		i can't get pidgin to work on my machine.  when i run it, nothing happens
2008-10-16T08:22:00.000Z	Kristie		is there something better i can use than pidgin?
2008-10-16T08:22:00.000Z	MidnighToker	Kristie	you could try running it from a terminal and see if it tells you anything, and as for better.... no, not so much :S  aMSN gives you msn but is more flaky than pidgin
2008-10-16T08:23:00.000Z	Kristie	MiddleOfNowhere	when i ran pidgin from the terminal, nothing happened, it just returned the prompt
2008-10-16T08:23:00.000Z	Kristie		i must have uninstalled something to make it not work :/
2008-10-16T08:24:00.000Z	MidnighToker	Kristie	wow, i just ran it and got thousands of lines of debugging :S
