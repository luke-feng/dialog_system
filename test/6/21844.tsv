2010-06-04T09:42:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero		anyone know what it means when the little audio speaker logo in my upper panel blinks between a speaker with sound waves and an empty speaker with little dotted lines coming out?
2010-06-04T09:43:00.000Z	theadmin	linux_is_my_hero	I think "little dots" is when sound is off
2010-06-04T09:43:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	theadmin	thats what i thought but it alretnated between the two on its own, right after i logged in.  only did for like 10 seconds, then went to normal.  also never lost sound output at all.
2010-06-04T09:44:00.000Z	theadmin	linux_is_my_hero	Probably a bug
2010-06-04T09:46:00.000Z	linux_is_my_hero	theadmin	yeah i bet youre right. i also have been issues with jacksense, so im sure itll fix itself over time...like everything does.
