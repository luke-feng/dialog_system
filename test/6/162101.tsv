2004-11-18T14:44:00.000Z	ogra	Pugio	looks like your CD is corrupt, try burning slower
2004-11-18T14:46:00.000Z	ogra	Pugio	i dunno if its on the ppc version too, but there should be a option to check the medium before boot
2004-11-18T14:47:00.000Z	ogra	Pugio	same disk ?
2004-11-18T14:48:00.000Z	ogra	Pugio	not a medium issue then
