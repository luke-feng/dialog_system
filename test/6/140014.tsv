2005-08-25T12:29:00.000Z	jbull	barongas	 what's the program looking for?
2005-08-25T12:30:00.000Z	barongas	jbull	checking for gtk+-2.0 >= 2.0.0... Package gtk+-2.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
2005-08-25T12:31:00.000Z	jbull	barongas	 you need the gtk+ dev package installed--do you have it?
2005-08-25T12:31:00.000Z	barongas	jbull	Yeah, noticed :)
2005-08-25T12:31:00.000Z	barongas	jbull	Thanks though
