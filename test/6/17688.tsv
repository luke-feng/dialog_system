2011-06-07T03:53:00.000Z	Scunizi		I have a suddenly discovered the "zoom" feature that enlarges everything on the screen.. but can't figure out how to get it back to normal.. one monitor is now "zoomed" and I can zoom individual windows like gmail more but not "un-zoom" the entire screen.. how do I do it?
