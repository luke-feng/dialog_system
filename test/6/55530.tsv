2008-06-24T05:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	vypadkovyy	yes it does, but its got nothing to do w/ beryl, never did actually
2008-06-24T05:14:00.000Z	vypadkovyy		to install a theme in emerald, download the tarball to a location, then open the emerald theme manager and select import, then choose the theme you want
2008-06-24T05:14:00.000Z	vypadkovyy	IndyGunFreak	i never disputed that :) emerald is just a window decorator
2008-06-24T05:15:00.000Z	vypadkovyy	IndyGunFreak	you could easily decorate beryl or compiz with metacity or kwin or anything else :)
