2010-10-23T15:01:00.000Z	ectospasm	oddy	there isn't one "BSD"
2010-10-23T15:02:00.000Z	oddy	ectospasm	yeah but all of the BSD distros are security centric
2010-10-23T15:02:00.000Z	ectospasm	oddy	oh, and GNU/Linux isn't?
2010-10-23T15:02:00.000Z	oddy	ectospasm	i'm thinking more along the lines of linus' "masturbating monkeys" remark
2010-10-23T15:02:00.000Z	ectospasm	oddy	I'd wager MacOSX isn't "security centric"
