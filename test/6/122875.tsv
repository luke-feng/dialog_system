2007-02-05T07:27:00.000Z	mdeboer	mytruehero	do you have windows installed on that machine?
2007-02-05T07:27:00.000Z	mytruehero	mdeboer	Yes.
2007-02-05T07:28:00.000Z	mdeboer	mytruehero	i read something about being able to install ubuntu from windows, but i have no idea if it is still experimental
2007-02-05T07:29:00.000Z	mytruehero	mdeboer	Do you mean this? http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2007/01/17/about-the-ubuntu-installer-for-windows/ It looks like that will install Ubuntu on my Windows partition. Not really what I'm after.
2007-02-05T07:29:00.000Z	mdeboer	mytruehero	uhm yes, that's it.
