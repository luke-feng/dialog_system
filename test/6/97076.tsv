2007-08-31T09:39:00.000Z	kauer	Scunizi	looked at partimage doc just now, there doesn't seem to be any facility for skipping bad blicks. Have I missed that? Anyway, since this disk is defective, there will be bad blocks, and whatever program is reading it must be able to skip them. It's no good to me if it clags on bad blocks...
2007-08-31T09:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	kauer	is it a system disk with windows?  have you tried booting from win cd and choose console recovery. at the prompt type chkdsk /R.  It may make it good enough to do a partimage backup.
