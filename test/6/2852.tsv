2012-04-15T20:56:00.000Z	Nik05		I wanted to change a password of a user and used sudo
2012-04-15T20:56:00.000Z	Nik05		it asked for new password x2, and then it hang for 2 minutes
2012-04-15T20:57:00.000Z	Nik05		after that it said password changed sucessfully
2012-04-15T20:57:00.000Z	comgen	Nik05	: sudo passwd  = will change roots password not the user just type passwd
