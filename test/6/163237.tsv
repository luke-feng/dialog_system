2004-10-13T05:11:00.000Z	coravel		hi, i've never tried debian or debian based distros, i'm a long time slackware user, i wonder if ubuntu is for me as it is said to have releases every six months with new GNOME versions?
2004-10-13T05:11:00.000Z	coravel		any ideas?
2004-10-13T05:12:00.000Z	micX	coravel	you won't know unless you try...
2004-10-13T05:12:00.000Z	micX	coravel	no-one here will know.
2004-10-13T05:13:00.000Z	micX	coravel	the package system rocks!
