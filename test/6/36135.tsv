2009-06-11T21:28:00.000Z	tiyowan	linuxninja	Um, well, we're all volunteers here.
2009-06-11T21:28:00.000Z	linuxninja	tiyowan	I want to take the Ubuntu certification
2009-06-11T21:29:00.000Z	tiyowan	linuxninja	Well, this is the ubuntu support channel; if you have any questions related to the certification, I think you need to look on their website for that.
2009-06-11T21:30:00.000Z	linuxninja	tiyowan	Ya, I sent out an email and I'm watching #ubuntu-training
2009-06-11T21:30:00.000Z	linuxninja	tiyowan	Will see what they say
