2008-09-19T07:34:00.000Z	jrib	jahnkeanater	I don't think so, but ask #vbox
2008-10-20T00:34:00.000Z	jrib	jahnkeanater	sure, just make it start system -> administration -> system monitor
2008-12-14T08:59:00.000Z	jrib	jahnkeanater	##windows for windows questions
2008-12-14T09:00:00.000Z	jrib	jahnkeanater	if you are having a windows issue, this is the wrong channel.  Be patient in ##windows
2008-12-14T09:01:00.000Z	jrib	jahnkeanater	it doesn't matter.  Anyone that wants to support windows will be in ##windows
