2006-11-18T09:28:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ivx	what OS is on the computer where the printer is attached?
2006-11-18T09:29:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ivx	setup cups to allow sharing on the network, on the machine with the printer, setup cups for a 'network printer' using 'ipp' as the type on the other one, should be good to go

2006-11-18T10:05:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ivx	'hostname'
