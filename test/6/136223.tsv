2006-07-25T08:59:00.000Z	srikat		does ubuntu installer ask for GRUB location? if so, is it C: drive?
2006-07-25T09:00:00.000Z	srikat		for a comp that has xp pro running at C:, is the MBR on C:?
2006-07-25T09:01:00.000Z	srikat		I've taken a screenshot of my current partitions..can you guys kindly look at it and tell me where MBR would be?
