2010-12-21T04:03:00.000Z	ohzie		Hey guys. I removed the sound icon from one of my panels and I can't figureo ut how to add it back on. I know this seems silly and trivial, but it's not in the list of applets. :(
2010-12-21T04:03:00.000Z	ohzie		Any ideas?
2010-12-21T04:03:00.000Z	ohzie		Oh, ubuntu 10.04
2010-12-21T04:03:00.000Z	hippytaff	ohzie	should just be a matter of right clicking on the panel and selecting it1?
2010-12-21T04:06:00.000Z	ohzie	hippytaff	Yeah it's not in the applet list, is my problem. :
2010-12-21T04:08:00.000Z	hippytaff	ohzie	was it there by default? I don't have a sound effort on any of my panels?
