2007-11-28T09:22:00.000Z	JPSman	nomasteryoda	- aplay: device_list:204: no soundcards found...
2007-11-28T09:23:00.000Z	JPSman	nomasteryoda	- I have a Creative Labs Soundblaster X-Fi soundcard...there is no linux support for 32-bit systems
2007-11-28T09:23:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	JPSman	ok... so the sound card modules are not loading for your hardware...
2007-11-28T09:24:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	JPSman	hmmm i'm betting you could make something work for it... but then again, I have seen a very few cards that don't work
2007-11-28T09:24:00.000Z	JPSman	nomasteryoda	- I just lucked out to have low to no support for THIS card :OP
