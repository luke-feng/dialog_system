2007-08-01T11:38:00.000Z	riotkittie		i don't consider sudo "alarmist crap", given the distro
2007-08-01T11:38:00.000Z	avis	riotkittie	if you are unhappy using ubuntu your welcome to use another one
2007-08-01T11:39:00.000Z	riotkittie	avis	gee, thanks. i wasnt aware that i had gone on a tirade about loathing the distro or had said anything negative about it.
2007-08-01T11:39:00.000Z	avis	riotkittie	i wasn't sure how to interpret that i thought you were flaming ubuntu
2007-08-01T11:40:00.000Z	riotkittie	avis	oh, i wasnt :P
