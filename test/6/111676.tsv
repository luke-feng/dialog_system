2006-09-24T05:16:00.000Z	aquafina		you can just create/delete partitions
2006-09-24T05:17:00.000Z	aquafina		after that, you use the mkfs command to do it
2006-09-24T05:17:00.000Z	vorbote	aquafina	fdisk and cfdisk will not format a partition automatically. That's left for the user to do. OTOH, parted can create a partition and format it automatically.

2006-09-24T05:17:00.000Z	aquafina	vorbote	ok
