2007-11-22T03:00:00.000Z	rich1		hi.  i added icedtea java and made it default to get miro working.  miro worked but java in mozilla browsers didn't.
2007-11-22T03:00:00.000Z	rich1		i made sun java the default again and removed icedtea java but now applets load verrrrry slowly.  any ideas?
2007-11-22T03:01:00.000Z	Udmin	rich1	apt-get install sun-java6-plugin
2007-11-22T03:02:00.000Z	rich1	Udmin	i tried that.  reinsatlled it.  but applets don't work at all in swiftweasel even though java.com says everything is good.
