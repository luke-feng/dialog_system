2009-06-04T19:46:00.000Z	Raylz	straterra	you have to install the bootloader to the usb stick
2009-06-04T19:47:00.000Z	Raylz	straterra	on the last prompt before you install it there is some button advanced i guess
2009-06-04T19:48:00.000Z	Raylz	straterra	there you can set the device where the bootloader will be installed
