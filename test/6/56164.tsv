2009-03-08T21:38:00.000Z	abe3k		guys, is there anyway of getting the old gnome-system-monitor ?, like from ubuntu 6.x ? and install it on interpid ?
2009-03-08T21:39:00.000Z	defrysk	abe3k	unlikely due to dependency inconsistencies
2009-03-08T21:40:00.000Z	abe3k	defrysk	I've really had it with the current system monitor its really heavy and power consuming
2009-03-08T21:41:00.000Z	defrysk	abe3k	turn it off ?
2009-03-08T21:41:00.000Z	abe3k	defrysk	and use what ?
