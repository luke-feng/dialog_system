2009-12-10T08:58:00.000Z	KeithBilly		Hello, i have 9.04 which was working just fine for the first few days. I shut down the system for a week or more, now when i started it back up and try and login it crashes after login and relaunches the login screen, over and over and over again. What can i do to try and resolve this?
