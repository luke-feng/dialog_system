2006-09-16T10:10:00.000Z	sethk	Hor|zon	be that as it may, there is nothing wrong with using /etc/hosts, and, in fact, it is a good thing to do for static addresses.
2006-09-16T15:54:00.000Z	Hor|zon	sethk	that's not exactly true, you might need to tar it if the media doesn't support the permissions, right?
2006-09-16T15:55:00.000Z	sethk	Hor|zon	I was assuming that it supports permissions, that's true.
2006-09-16T15:55:00.000Z	sethk	Hor|zon	and tar or cpio is a good way to work around that, if permissions are not supported
