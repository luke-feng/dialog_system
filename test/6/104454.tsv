2006-10-19T15:04:00.000Z	Daviey	BoyBach	what happens when you go to Places -> Network Servers?
2006-10-19T15:07:00.000Z	Daviey	BoyBach	Your using Ubuntu with Gnome right?  If you click Places then go to Network Servers does it come up empty?
2006-10-19T15:07:00.000Z	Daviey	BoyBach	I don't understand what you mean
2006-10-19T15:08:00.000Z	Daviey	BoyBach	is it showing your share?
2006-10-19T15:08:00.000Z	Daviey	BoyBach	from there you should be able to mount it (if you want)
