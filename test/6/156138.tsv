2006-06-03T13:44:00.000Z	ups		My gnome-panel has been behaving weirdly lately - the icons in the menus dont appear, the window list applet disappeared
2006-06-03T13:45:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	ups	I got that too. I dumped gnome, not the kind of behavior I associate with linux
2006-06-03T13:45:00.000Z	ups	YoussefAssad	not the answer i'm looking for...
2006-06-03T13:45:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	ups	Didn't bother troubleshooting, ran back to openbox
2006-06-03T13:45:00.000Z	YoussefAssad	ups	Sorry :)
