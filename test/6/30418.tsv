2011-05-14T12:40:00.000Z	no_face		i seen many methods, not sure which is the safest one to move
2011-05-14T12:40:00.000Z	no_face		no, moving from a 500GB to a 1TB
2011-05-14T12:41:00.000Z	no_face		internal
2011-05-14T12:41:00.000Z	no_face		rsync from what i have seen is the safe bet
2011-05-14T12:42:00.000Z	pfifo	no_face	rsync is resumable and faster
