2010-06-08T23:22:00.000Z	StaRetji	resno	thx dude, I was advised to install bootchart to see what's holding boot process. I tried installing bootchart via apt-get (live usb system with persistent storage) and it hanged the pc. I rebooted and now I'm stuck in a loop, can't use apt-get anymore, just dpkg --configure -a
2010-06-08T23:23:00.000Z	StaRetji	resno	if I use dpkg --configure -a it will hang again while trying to "update-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-2.6.32-21-generic"
