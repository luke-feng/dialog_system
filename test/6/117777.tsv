2006-05-17T15:14:00.000Z	syndicate47	NoUse	bbrazil i don't know why but the samba shares dissappears from the network after about 12 hours
2006-05-17T15:14:00.000Z	NoUse	syndicate47	have you check your samba logs?
2006-05-17T15:17:00.000Z	syndicate47	NoUse	no, there are too many logs and i don't know which to check
