2010-08-05T10:24:00.000Z	razz1	PythonPup	will install freenx and see how it goes, thnx
2010-08-05T10:25:00.000Z	razz1	PythonPup	by the way how it change between users on the server with out losing the connection?
2010-08-05T12:11:00.000Z	PythonPup	razz1	I used the default one under System/Preferences/Remote Desktop.  On xubuntu, I setup vino.
