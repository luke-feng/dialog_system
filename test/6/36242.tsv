2009-06-10T02:08:00.000Z	cabrey	nellmathew	is it rss?
2009-06-10T02:09:00.000Z	nellmathew	cabrey	i don't think so - i want to make banshee like songbird w/ the shoutcast section (it automatically lists all of shoutcasts stations).. from what i understand they don't have a rss feed though
2009-06-10T02:10:00.000Z	cabrey	nellmathew	hmm i use banshee but i havent heard of shoutcast. maybe someone wrote a plugin?
