2008-03-02T08:06:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	lsth	those are buttons on your keyboard
2008-03-02T08:07:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	lsth	you are right it does. that will enable you to undo the changes you have made
2008-03-02T08:11:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	lsth	seems you have ignored the one person trying to help you
2008-03-02T08:19:00.000Z	proprietarysucks	lsth	what does the screen say after you press ctrl-alt-backspace?
