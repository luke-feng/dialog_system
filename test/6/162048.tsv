2004-12-01T11:10:00.000Z	TenPlus1		Does everyone using the Ubuntu distro, do you think it's easy to use and has the s/w u need ??
2004-12-01T11:11:00.000Z	imnes	TenPlus1	yes, but I wish it could include the non-supported types, like Java, Macromedia natively instead of having to go through the extra steps to isntall them.
2004-12-01T11:12:00.000Z	imnes	TenPlus1	They're easy to install, just not in by default.
2004-12-01T11:13:00.000Z	imnes	TenPlus1	I'm not sure, I've never tried to share my files with a windows machine.
