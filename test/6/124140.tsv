2006-03-09T08:49:00.000Z	humon	ompaul	thanks
2006-03-09T08:49:00.000Z	humon	ompaul	but that also brings down the interface, is there another command that just releases the leased ip address?
2006-03-09T08:50:00.000Z	ompaul	humon	well you can do "sudo dhclient"
2006-03-09T08:50:00.000Z	humon	ompaul	ok, thank you
