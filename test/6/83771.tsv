2007-06-25T11:43:00.000Z	persica	apadox	sorry, I misspoke.  But for you, you're trying to do an alternate install on a laptop, starting with an image of the CD on your desktop?
2007-06-25T11:44:00.000Z	persica	apadox	Yes, there is a way to install GRUB on the MBR of that notebook harddisk.  However, if you aren't installing on the notebook itself you'll have a lot of trouble with some of the hardware detection I think.
2007-06-25T11:46:00.000Z	persica	apadox	What you will probably want to do is run the CD from your desktop, install on your laptop's harddrive (you said you have it hooked up, right?) but you'll want to skip the grub step and do it manually.
