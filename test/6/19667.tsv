2010-06-21T03:50:00.000Z	hilem		how do i see what packages are currently installed on 10.04?
2010-06-21T03:50:00.000Z	iceroot	hilem	dpkg -l
2010-06-21T03:51:00.000Z	hilem	iceroot	thanks!
2010-06-21T03:51:00.000Z	iceroot	hilem	maybe dpkg -l | grep ii > my-packages.txt   is a better idea
2010-06-21T03:52:00.000Z	hilem	iceroot	 i can grep the output for what i'm looking for... i just didn't know the command offhand
2010-06-21T03:52:00.000Z	iceroot	hilem	ah ok
