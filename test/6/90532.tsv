2007-06-04T14:45:00.000Z	Jowi	eetfuk	depends on the chipset. the "via" driver should have dri enabled (for via chipsets that is)
2007-06-04T14:46:00.000Z	eetfuk	Jowi	i think my card is VN800, not sure about the chipset thought
2007-06-04T14:49:00.000Z	eetfuk	Jowi	thanks it worked
2007-06-04T14:49:00.000Z	Jowi	eetfuk	you're welcome
2007-06-04T15:03:00.000Z	Jowi	eetfuk	I doubt beryl will work with the via chipset since it only provides very simple 3d accelleration. only intel, ati and nvidia supported I think.
