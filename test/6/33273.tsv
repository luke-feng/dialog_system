2009-10-31T23:00:00.000Z	trism	Spirits-Sight	the default tool in XP works fine for me for defragging
2009-10-31T23:00:00.000Z	Spirits-Sight	trism	where you find it? I have not used XP long time
2009-10-31T23:01:00.000Z	trism	Spirits-Sight	been a while since I used XP too, I believe it is either under Accessories/System Tools, or if you click properites on the drive there should be an option
