2009-11-29T10:53:00.000Z	Billiard	drastic	which websites return a blank page?
2009-11-29T10:53:00.000Z	Billiard	drastic	behind a proxy?
2009-11-29T10:54:00.000Z	drastic	Billiard	Seemingly random sites, ubuntu.com works fine but ubuntuforums.org doesn't. Not sure about a proxy, but I am behind a router.
2009-11-29T10:55:00.000Z	drastic	Billiard	The sites that work seem to change, as well, Google was working but isn't any longer...
2009-11-29T11:00:00.000Z	Billiard	drastic	do other computers on your network do this?
