2011-09-25T12:17:00.000Z	ubuntu_		I have a question - I am new to linux.  I have lubuntu running now from my usb stick and do not want to instal it but run it here on a live usb but every time I reboot I lose my personal settings
2011-09-25T12:18:00.000Z	ubuntu_		i made it with  1gb persistence
2011-09-25T12:18:00.000Z	ubuntu_		it still does not work
2011-09-25T12:20:00.000Z	ubuntu_		alternative might work on a 4gb usb?
2011-09-25T12:21:00.000Z	htlm	ubuntu_	did you think  reading the docs of it...  and 3gb is what I say if need after updates programs and finally your data or aka files
2011-09-25T12:28:00.000Z	htlm	ubuntu_	yes it work.. 4gb is fine for web surfing few pdfs homework ... and Linux can do all that.. but the space you give it is the thing you want more of.... like a 26page PowerPoint all decked out and and all the multimedia on the flash drive included....its about full... so get a 8gb or up to a 16gb just it just depends on you n your needs...lol but if your like some of us.. even me.   lol you'll fill it up fast !
