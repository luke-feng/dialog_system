2007-12-13T13:13:00.000Z	sploodge		Ugh... I've screwed up Ubuntu so much.
2007-12-13T13:14:00.000Z	sploodge		Would anyone here advise me to switch to Gentoo?
2007-12-13T13:14:00.000Z	thor	sploodge	not if you are having problems with ubuntu
2007-12-13T13:15:00.000Z	thor	sploodge	well...one by one you fix them...you fix linux, it isn't like windows
2007-12-13T13:17:00.000Z	thor	sploodge	well..if you have removed as much as possible reinstall it all and then start fixing it. you probably just have a config file you have not yet take care of.
2007-12-13T13:18:00.000Z	thor	sploodge	but to move to gentoo...it is much more techie than ubuntu and would be harder to get working
