2010-06-10T23:01:00.000Z	youevilmonkey		I'm trying to follow the directions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx but i'm using ubuntu 6.06 and some of this isn't right (i don't see "Hardware Drivers" in the list)
2010-06-10T23:02:00.000Z	youevilmonkey		Yes, until yesterday I was using windows but had some lame trojan that was impeding with my internet connection.  I had had a disc for ubuntu 6.06 lying around for the last 4 years and it was really my only option
