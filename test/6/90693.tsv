2007-03-31T06:47:00.000Z	NorthernLights	LjL	why disabling proposed updates seem so important ?
2007-03-31T06:48:00.000Z	LjL	NorthernLights	because the reason that they're called "Proposed" is that they weren't tested yet. they'll likely break your system at one point or another.
2007-03-31T06:48:00.000Z	NorthernLights	LjL	i'll keep that in mind, thanks
2007-03-31T06:58:00.000Z	NorthernLights	LjL	how many fully work ?
2007-03-31T06:59:00.000Z	LjL	NorthernLights	no idea... how many Windows programs are there around? it's kind of hard to make a statistic ;)
2007-03-31T06:59:00.000Z	LjL	NorthernLights	i suppose "a few" work perfectly, and "a lot" sort of work
