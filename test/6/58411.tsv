2008-11-18T00:51:00.000Z	joaopinto	Macros42	do you have nfs support installed ?
2008-11-18T00:51:00.000Z	Macros42	joaopinto	I don't think so - in Connect to Server it's not listed - I thought it was default tho - how do I install it?
2008-11-18T00:52:00.000Z	joaopinto	Macros42	sudo apt-get install nfs-common
2008-11-18T00:53:00.000Z	Macros42	joaopinto	is it just nfs-client I need to install?
2008-11-18T00:53:00.000Z	joaopinto	Macros42	yes, that should do it
