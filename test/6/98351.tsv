2008-08-22T05:24:00.000Z	effowe		hey what iso do I download with an intel q6600 processor?
2008-08-22T05:25:00.000Z	effowe		4gb
2008-08-22T05:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	effowe	i agree w/ wols on that
2008-08-22T05:25:00.000Z	effowe		hm, no 64 bit support?
2008-08-22T05:26:00.000Z	effowe	wols	well not necessarily, but im coming off of an x2 4200+ machine running 64 bit, just wondering if i could get back on it
2008-08-22T05:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	effowe	32bit supports a wider range of hardware, software, etc.. so unless you have some reason to "need" 64bit... i'd stick w/ 32bit for the time being, for the best comppatibility
