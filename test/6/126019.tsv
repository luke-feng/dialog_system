2007-04-21T10:18:00.000Z	yagami		Hi- can anyone tell me how to get rid of saved gnome sessions?
2007-04-21T10:19:00.000Z	maccam94	yagami	system -> preferences -> sessions
2007-04-21T10:21:00.000Z	yagami	maccam94	so what about the session- what i am specifically looking for is an ini file that i can delete- or do i have to save the present session as an empty session?
2007-04-21T10:23:00.000Z	maccam94	yagami	oh whoops, it looks like it's changed since edgy :-\ sorry
2007-04-21T10:23:00.000Z	yagami	maccam94	no probs. u've already saved it
2007-04-21T10:23:00.000Z	maccam94	yagami	ah, kk
