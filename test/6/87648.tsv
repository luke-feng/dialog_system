2007-07-18T16:02:00.000Z	elpargo	askand	are you referring to the save state?
2007-07-18T16:03:00.000Z	askand	elpargo	 hrm..when I unmaximize a window..and resize it with the mouse..it doesn remembering the size after restarting
2007-07-18T16:05:00.000Z	elpargo	askand	umm is it keep as maximized? I don't see why the mouse resize will be different.
2007-07-18T16:06:00.000Z	askand	elpargo	hrm..it seems to revert to "standardsize" after I restart=a little bit lessthan maximized
2007-07-18T16:08:00.000Z	elpargo	askand	weird indeed , why don't you try #gnome on gimp.net maybe there is a setting you need to toggle
2007-07-18T16:08:00.000Z	askand	elpargo	okok thanks
