2009-05-09T04:38:00.000Z	Huufarted	h2g2bob	will that allow any scripts in that directory to execute without having to specify the path?
2009-05-09T04:39:00.000Z	h2g2bob	Huufarted	yep, for the current bash session only. It will search that folder before /bin and /usr/bin as normal. To make it permanent add those lines to ~/.bashrc
2009-05-09T04:40:00.000Z	h2g2bob	Huufarted	hbekel suggests using PATH="$PATH:/home/user/whatever" so you look in /bin and /usr/bin first
2009-05-09T04:40:00.000Z	Huufarted	h2g2bob	aye I'm doing that.  :)  Thanks a bunch.
