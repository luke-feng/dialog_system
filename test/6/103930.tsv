2006-12-17T06:38:00.000Z	PriceChild	gaurav19	you "can"... however defrag your drives before attempting resizing
2006-12-17T06:39:00.000Z	PriceChild	gaurav19	backup ALL important data
2006-12-17T06:41:00.000Z	PriceChild	gaurav19	good luck
2006-12-17T06:43:00.000Z	PriceChild	gaurav19	you shouldn't have any problems... just make sure you use the correct drives ;)
2006-12-17T06:43:00.000Z	PriceChild	gaurav19	most problems come when resizing...
