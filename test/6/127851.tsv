2005-12-31T15:08:00.000Z	eric_		that's good, I just remember having to do that with windows, or registry problems
2005-12-31T15:09:00.000Z	eric_		thanks for the info, Linux is just a load off my mind.
2005-12-31T15:09:00.000Z	eric_		With windows you had to worry about all of that stuff to keep it running
2005-12-31T15:11:00.000Z	eric_		I'm in love with linux, Ubuntu to be exact.
