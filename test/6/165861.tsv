2005-01-31T14:07:00.000Z	tanek		how do I change the default output card for alsa? i finally (somehow, don't really know how) got my sound working after trying a week (!!!), but now, to be able to use it i have to manually change sound card in the options (XMMS is the only thing I've got working yet)

2005-01-31T14:08:00.000Z	tanek		think it all started working when i installed xmms-mad that uninstalled gstreamer-packages
