2005-04-16T14:42:00.000Z	radikal1	afrosheen	I get an error when I try to play something with xmms that says my sound card isn't configured correctly
2005-04-16T14:43:00.000Z	afrosheen	radikal1	if that's the issue, you'll need to dig a little deepr
2005-04-16T14:43:00.000Z	radikal1	afrosheen	that's why I was wondering if there was any sort of setup utility for sound cards
