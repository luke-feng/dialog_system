2009-09-23T22:04:00.000Z	djzn		I am buying a mobo today, and I just have two choices: NVIDIA Chipset with Gefore 7025 and AMD690/SB600 with Radeon... for LiNUX, which one should I buy...
2009-09-23T22:04:00.000Z	djzn		isn't Radeon X1200 mature enough in linux?
2009-09-23T22:04:00.000Z	racecar56	djzn	nvidia
2009-09-23T22:05:00.000Z	racecar56	djzn	ati + linux = fail
2009-09-23T22:05:00.000Z	racecar56	djzn	although i have seen the X1270 work quite well with the opensource driver
2009-09-23T22:06:00.000Z	djzn	racecar56	I don't wand to find out that the ATI driver does not give 80 features that it's got in windows, later on, know what I mean?
