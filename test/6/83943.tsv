2007-06-28T08:41:00.000Z	eboyjr		Well, I don't... but I just wanted to get more accustomed. ;)

2007-06-28T08:43:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	eboyjr	i don't think your laptop meets the minimum requirements to run Ubuntu.  let me double check.
2007-06-28T08:46:00.000Z	dawn`chorus	eboyjr	oh.  i'm sorry.  i thought you were wanting to install Ubuntu on 16MB of RAM.
