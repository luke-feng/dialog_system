2009-06-20T04:08:00.000Z	FrozenFire		Is it possible to launch an application to a specific workspace?
2009-06-20T04:09:00.000Z	VCoolio	FrozenFire	don't know if compiz can do that, at least devilspie can I think, google that one
2009-06-20T04:13:00.000Z	VCoolio	FrozenFire	yes, devilspie can, read http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2007/07/25/how-to-set-default-workspace-size-and-window-effects-in-gnome/, there is an example on firefox to open on workspace 2
2009-06-20T05:27:00.000Z	VCoolio	FrozenFire	do you use compiz? isn't there an option to name your workspaces in compiz? Don't know if that would help
2009-06-20T05:27:00.000Z	FrozenFire	VCoolio	I use what is essentially a vanilla install.
2009-06-20T05:27:00.000Z	VCoolio	FrozenFire	barely ever heard of, sorry
