2007-03-13T13:02:00.000Z	AlexC_	vicks	do you know Feisty is under heavy development?
2007-03-13T13:03:00.000Z	vicks	AlexC_	yeah. preaction: yeah, i asked there but the channel was pretty dead, i was hoping anyone here could help me
2007-03-13T13:03:00.000Z	AlexC_	vicks	that's ok then. Just I've seen like 7-8 people using Feisty and complaing when it doesn't work - not knowing it was under development.
2007-03-13T13:04:00.000Z	vicks	AlexC_	yeah, luckily ubuntu has a quite friendly irc
