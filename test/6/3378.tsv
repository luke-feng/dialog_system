2012-03-10T18:24:00.000Z	trijntje	monser	that sounds like a really bad idea, dont do that
2012-03-10T18:25:00.000Z	trijntje	monser	why would you want to do that? Bad idea!
2012-03-10T18:27:00.000Z	monser	trijntje	this is not an free soft attitude
2012-03-10T18:28:00.000Z	trijntje	monser	the point is that it's dangerous to do that. And if you have to ask help to set an empty root password, it *really* dangerous
