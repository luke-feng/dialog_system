2006-12-07T12:23:00.000Z	wavefunction		In what file do I have the default window manager defined ?
2006-12-07T12:25:00.000Z	dabaR	wavefunction	.dmrc
2006-12-07T12:29:00.000Z	wavefunction	dabaR	Thanks ! But is there a global way to do this. I mean for every user, a system wide configuration ?
2006-12-07T12:29:00.000Z	dabaR	wavefunction	I do not know.
2006-12-07T12:29:00.000Z	wavefunction	dabaR	Anyway, thanks for the help ! :)
