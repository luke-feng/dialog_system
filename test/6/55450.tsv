2008-06-27T18:50:00.000Z	zloog	Sock	I believe that the fonts installed by default with ubuntu will be free.
2008-06-27T18:51:00.000Z	Sock	zloog	yea but under what license ? ununtu is free so it can distribute it on some "free license" but i cant
2008-06-27T18:52:00.000Z	zloog	Sock	I think everything in the main repo (not universe restricted or multiverse) is free for commercial use. After all canonical is a commercial entity
2008-06-27T18:53:00.000Z	Sock		ok, great i wanted to make shore it wasn't covered with some GPL alike license, tnx
2008-06-27T18:54:00.000Z	zloog	Sock	Obviously you gotta be safe legally tho
