2009-07-07T19:49:00.000Z	bronze		it "reads" the package managment files on an existing system and creates an installion tool that installs exactly the same set of packages on a other systems, so you can replicate exactly the same install on as many systemsas you want.

2009-07-07T19:50:00.000Z	Boohbah	bronze	 dpkg --get-selections |grep -v deinstall |awk {'print $1'} > installed_list

2009-07-07T19:52:00.000Z	bronze	Boohbah	but its an excellent idea.
