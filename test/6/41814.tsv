2010-08-22T19:09:00.000Z	abc_		Is there any significant difference between ubuntu netbook vs desktop eddition
2010-08-22T19:09:00.000Z	abc_		?
2010-08-22T19:10:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	abc_	Desktop you can do anything with, while Netbook is "locked down" these days... just opinion
2010-08-22T19:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	abc_	i'd recommend using desktop if you have the space (personal opinion though)
2010-08-22T19:11:00.000Z	abc_	ZykoticK9	didn't get you over "locked down" ?
2010-08-22T19:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	abc_	you can't make changes to the Netbook interface that used to be possible
