2011-04-30T16:38:00.000Z	kkal		thanks
2011-04-30T16:40:00.000Z	kkal		also, unity seems very laggy, especially with launching applications. Is that intended?
2011-04-30T16:42:00.000Z	kkal		another question: launching firefox takes about 2-3 seconds. Is that normal?
2011-04-30T16:42:00.000Z	kkal		this is with unity
2011-04-30T16:42:00.000Z	LjL	kkal	2-3 seconds doesn't seem like a lot...
