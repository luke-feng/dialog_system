2005-04-21T09:23:00.000Z	shannon		thanks cef, I think I'll just get him to do that, e safe. I don't want him seeing X fail to start
2005-04-21T09:25:00.000Z	shannon		Warty: It shouldn't start up in the console. Are you talking about after youn installed it or the first time you put in the CD?
2005-04-21T09:26:00.000Z	shannon		Warty: the install is text-based, but very simple. After install, you'll see console text scroll past as it boots but it should leave you at a graphical login
2005-04-21T09:28:00.000Z	shannon		Has anyone tried gdesklets from Hoary? Do the desklets work? Do the weather ones work out of the box?
2005-04-21T09:28:00.000Z	libben	shannon	plz try to install the gdesklet and gdesklets-data
