2009-10-31T11:35:00.000Z	GJLenon	metaphlex	 By nature, flash runs on your system, only using the Internet to send small packets back and forth, as opposed to playing a server based game.  Are you purposefully trying to crash Flash or what?
2009-10-31T11:36:00.000Z	metaphlex	GJLenon	no, i'm just ignorant to a degree about HTML 5. If everyone still needs a flash plugin to play all of the millions of online games, how could html5 "kill" flash?
2009-10-31T11:40:00.000Z	GJLenon	metaphlex	 My understanding is that HTML 5 is being pushed by Microsoft to create an "industry standard" to control plug-ins.  An easy way to think about this is to compare it to DirectX.  Before DirectX there were many platforms, but DirectX was implimented and through added versatility and added benefits pushed all others out of the market until DirectX virtually controls all dynamic media.  Whether this is superior or not is up for debate.
2009-10-31T11:43:00.000Z	metaphlex	GJLenon	i thought microsoft was apprehensive about html5... also i don't want to add confusion to this chatroom, if this conversation is too off-topic is there a better channel someone may suggest?
2009-10-31T11:44:00.000Z	GJLenon	metaphlex	 Microsoft is the only company involved in the HTML 5 effort that is both a browser developer and an RIA tool developer.  They are apprehensive about it, but still supporting it.
