2007-05-24T11:45:00.000Z	Fivetwentysix		Just go into bios and make sure you boot from your Linux partition
2007-05-24T11:45:00.000Z	Fivetwentysix		Oh really?
2007-05-24T11:45:00.000Z	Akuma_	Fivetwentysix	i did this time
2007-05-24T11:46:00.000Z	Akuma_	Fivetwentysix	or if its not deleted, at least the BIOS doesn't seem to call it
