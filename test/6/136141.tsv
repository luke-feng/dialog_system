2010-02-21T07:22:00.000Z	lantizia		Hey I removed 2 things from my panel and I've no idea how to get them back (I can't see them in the list of things to add)... one was like a simple user switcher and another was like a little envelope !
2010-02-21T07:22:00.000Z	lantizia		ah found the first one!
2010-02-21T07:23:00.000Z	lantizia		oh and 2nd
2010-02-21T07:23:00.000Z	lantizia		what odd names they have
2010-02-21T07:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	lantizia	gnome 3.0 will use gnome-shell
2010-02-21T07:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	lantizia	check out gnome-shell, it's in the repos, it's hard to explain but the whole ui is different
