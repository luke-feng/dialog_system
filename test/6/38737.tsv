2009-05-27T17:00:00.000Z	rosepetal	h4mx0r	ive already upgraded. i am just asking how i can bring back the notifications feature back on ... the one which controls the new notifications that come in black color
2009-05-27T17:01:00.000Z	h4mx0r	rosepetal	its in system > prefernces > startup applications
2009-05-27T17:04:00.000Z	rosepetal	h4mx0r	its not in my startup applications since i removed it from the panel? not sure if that will happen though ... whats it called?
