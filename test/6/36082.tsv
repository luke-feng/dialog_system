2009-09-24T18:39:00.000Z	huwaw69	mattcen	uhmmm ill rephrase it, how do i identify my cdrom in ubuntu?
2009-09-24T18:40:00.000Z	mattcen	huwaw69	Identify what type it is, or what device it is mapped to? Usually, whatever device it is, it is accessible via /dev/cdrom
2009-09-24T18:41:00.000Z	huwaw69	mattcen	i meant uhmmm identify what cdrom name it is or other informations
2009-09-24T18:45:00.000Z	mattcen	huwaw69	A little bit of information can be found via dmesg, but I'm not sure where else you can find anything...
