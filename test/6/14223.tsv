2010-12-26T20:56:00.000Z	donCams		can anybody recommend a software that is as good as photoshop, illustrator, fireworks and dreamweaver for ubuntu? i'm thinking of trying out ubuntu. :)
2010-12-26T20:58:00.000Z	Emry	donCams	Depends on what you are trying to do exactly.  Check out Gimp and InkScape.  :-) They will do a lot of what Photoshop and Illustrator will do, but the interfaces are not the same. ^_^
2010-12-26T20:58:00.000Z	donCams	Emry	cool, i can adapt to new interfaces. just don't wana use wine. if i'm goin to use wine, might as well run windows... :)
2010-12-26T21:01:00.000Z	donCams	Emry	thought they canceled the idea
2010-12-26T21:02:00.000Z	Emry	donCams	Not sure.  I just heard about it recently.
2010-12-26T21:03:00.000Z	Emry	donCams	They did release a distro, LONG time ago... Gave up before actually polishing it up though. :P
