2008-05-07T01:33:00.000Z	Winkie	MrDowntempo	use GEdit? :)
2008-05-07T01:34:00.000Z	MrDowntempo	Winkie	wubrgamer: I thought if i said GUI too I wouldn't get that response ;) Guess I was wrong :)
2008-05-07T01:34:00.000Z	Winkie	MrDowntempo	really there is no requirement for any sort of extensive GUI
2008-05-07T01:35:00.000Z	MrDowntempo	Winkie	Oh I know. I'm familiar with manually making my own fstab file. I just wondered if there was a gtk menu sorta way to do it cuz I like to try new stuff
2008-05-07T01:35:00.000Z	Winkie	MrDowntempo	oh fair enough, nothing i'm aware of
