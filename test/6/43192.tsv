2009-07-31T01:44:00.000Z	denis|		after that i just can type any word and it will repeat it
2009-07-31T01:44:00.000Z	denis|		just the way cat is used to - to pipe its stdin to its stdout
2009-07-31T01:45:00.000Z	denis|		why
2009-07-31T01:45:00.000Z	denis|		when i type echo `cat` it allows me to type anything just like in plain cat
