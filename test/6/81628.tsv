2007-08-09T14:16:00.000Z	Daniel1979		I have a problem with a new laptop, I successfully installed Ununtu 7.04 with Vista as dual boot. The network works when Ubuntu is sole operating system or when you boot the live CD, but not after the install with vista on a separate partition! Any body think they can help me?
