2008-04-08T13:23:00.000Z	Frogzoo	[[thufir]]	maybe a repos down atm - try later
2008-04-08T13:23:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	Frogzoo	ok
2008-04-09T14:07:00.000Z	Frogzoo	[[thufir]]	root:root
2008-04-09T14:09:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	Frogzoo	thanks, I'll chown it
2008-04-09T14:11:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	Frogzoo	I still get:  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/62615/  for a php application though.  seems to be a permissions problem.
