2012-07-14T16:56:00.000Z	mankoff	BluesKaj	I'm not sure. I have purchased a laptop *specifically* for CUDA work I need to do, but am having trouble getting it set up...
2012-07-14T16:56:00.000Z	mankoff		Optimus seems different than CUDA?
2012-07-14T16:56:00.000Z	mankoff		In which case, bumblebee might not help?
2012-07-14T16:57:00.000Z	bekks	mankoff	In every other case.
