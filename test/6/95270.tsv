2007-01-26T17:40:00.000Z	shatrat	tarelerulz	I think the official number is like 2 gigs, but youll be really limited in what toys you can install
2007-01-26T17:40:00.000Z	shatrat	tarelerulz	My answer would be "how much have you got?"
2007-01-26T17:41:00.000Z	shatrat	tarelerulz	ouch.  YOu migth want to delete some crap from windows.
2007-01-26T17:41:00.000Z	shatrat	tarelerulz	that doesnt leave you much headroom in either OS
2007-01-26T17:42:00.000Z	shatrat	tarelerulz	sure does
