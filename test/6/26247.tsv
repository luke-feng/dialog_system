2010-08-13T10:06:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	st__	of course.  you could try disabling compiz if your currently running it.  X is Xorg or the GUI environment.

2010-11-16T03:24:00.000Z	st__	ZykoticK9	i couldn't make /tmp contents survive reboot :(
2010-11-22T07:18:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	st__	you can't, try using "sudo apt-get -f install" to fix
2010-11-22T07:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	st__	because it's broken/not working most likely
