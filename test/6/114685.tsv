2007-04-18T10:43:00.000Z	flake		where can I find my menu layout?
2007-04-18T10:44:00.000Z	flake		instead of having to scroll up and down a huge menu of games, i want to put the games into a subfolder in the games menu
2007-04-18T10:45:00.000Z	flake		this is gnome
2007-04-18T10:45:00.000Z	flake		now i can do it manually but one at a time using menu layout
2007-04-18T10:45:00.000Z	flake		drag and drop one at a time is a pain in the butt
