2010-07-11T20:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Zenze	 it does here.
2010-07-11T20:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Zenze	 theres some settings to enable/disable it.
2010-07-11T20:56:00.000Z	Zenze	Dr_Willis	I know there is the setting in System>Preferences>Power Management, however I am curious if that has any effect if I am not logged in
2010-07-11T20:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Zenze	 my external usb hd's all spin down ive noticed. never really noticed the internals. (too quiet)
