2006-07-23T09:54:00.000Z	ryan_naruto		is p3 500 256mb ram enough to make ubuntu run nicely
2006-07-23T09:54:00.000Z	bobbyd	ryan_naruto	it'll run :)
2006-07-23T09:58:00.000Z	bobbyd	ryan_naruto	maybe you need more ram, check what's running and uninstall some stuff...
2006-07-23T09:59:00.000Z	bobbyd	ryan_naruto	it should run just as fast, maybe your graphics hardware isn't installed properly
2006-07-23T09:59:00.000Z	bobbyd	ryan_naruto	check it's not using the vesa driver
