2010-02-28T11:21:00.000Z	lgc	joshuah	but I can't find lists in vlc. Only the input for the stream address.
2010-02-28T11:24:00.000Z	joshuah	lgc	yeah, I think you need to find em beforehand, there might be sites out there for that. googling around I found http://www.streamfinder.com/
2010-02-28T11:25:00.000Z	lgc	joshuah	thank. I'll take a look.
2010-02-28T11:25:00.000Z	joshuah	lgc	yeah
