2007-12-08T18:20:00.000Z	bjwebb		how do i check what packages have been updated recently?
2007-12-08T18:21:00.000Z	andrew_mcardle	bjwebb	you can open synaptic and view the history
2007-12-08T18:21:00.000Z	bjwebb	andrew_mcardle	don't use synaptic
2007-12-08T18:21:00.000Z	bjwebb		i was thinking cli actually
2007-12-08T18:22:00.000Z	andrew_mcardle	bjwebb	perhaps apt has a history function, check the man page
